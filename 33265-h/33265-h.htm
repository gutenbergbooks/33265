<h3>HOW TO BEGIN CLUB WORK</h3>

<p>The time has long since passed when a special plea is needed for the
existence of women's clubs, for actual demonstration has proved their
worth to the individual and to society. Multitudes of women on farms, on
remote ranches, in little villages, in great cities, have felt their
impetus to a broader and more useful life. They have instructed those of
limited education; they have given a wider horizon to those hemmed in by
circumstance; they have trained the timid to speak, and, of late years,
they have prepared the way for women of leisure and influence to take up
what is called "the larger housekeeping," the bettering of social and
civic conditions.</p>

<p>But many women to-day still feel a certain timidity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> about venturing to
start a club, and an inability to make out a consistent line of study.
They have a lingering idea that it is all difficult, and that only the
expert may try to handle these things. So for these women here are the
simple, fundamental things about club work, which any one can follow.</p>

<p>If you would like to organize a club, begin by making out a list of ten
or a dozen of your neighbors and friends, those whose interests are much
like your own, and tell them that you think it would be pleasant to have
some sort of a little circle for reading, or study, or social
companionship. Probably they will all have something to say about this,
and various ideas will be advanced as to the sort of club which is most
desirable. Then, after it is talked over, you, as the one who suggested
the meeting, will call the women to order and ask some one to nominate
and second a temporary chairman, and, after she is elected, a temporary
secretary.</p>

<p>When these two have taken their seats and the secretary is ready to
begin taking notes, the chairman will appoint several committees, with
perhaps two members on each.</p>

<p>The first will be the Nominating committee, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> present to the club the
names of candidates for the offices of president, vice-president,
secretary and treasurer.</p>

<p>The second will be on a Constitution, which is to draw up very simple
rules to guide the club, telling of its aims, the number of officers and
how they are to be elected, the dues, the time and place of meeting, and
whatever else is thought necessary.</p>

<p>The third committee will be on Name; it will prepare a list of titles to
be chosen from.</p>

<p>The fourth committee will be on Program. This will offer possible lines
of work.</p>

<p>These committees will be sufficient to begin with. The chairman can then
tell when and where the next meeting will be held and declare this one
adjourned.</p>

<p>At the second meeting the same chairman as before will take her place
and call for the reading of the minutes of the last meeting. When these
are read and accepted, she will ask for the report of the Nominating
committee, and when it is presented, the officers will be voted for,
either <i>viva</i> voce, or by ballot, as the club prefers.</p>

<p>The new president and secretary will then take their chairs, and the
business of hearing the reports of the other committees will go on. When
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> name for the club has been chosen, the constitution read and voted
upon article by article, and the program planned, the president will
name different chairmen to take charge of several following meetings;
then this first regular meeting may adjourn, feeling that the club is
successfully launched.</p>

<p>From this point the work should go on smoothly. The president will find
her part of it much easier, however, if she will get a little book,
called the Woman's Manual of Parliamentary Law, to which she can refer
when any point of order comes up with which she is not familiar.</p>

<p>Once a club is started, the great question is, What shall we study? And
of course the field is limited only by the tastes, the education of the
members, and the number of books to which the club can have access. If
there is a good public library, they may choose almost any literary
subject. If there is none, the next thing is to find out if a travelling
library can be had from the state librarian, and whether enough books
can be borrowed to cover the whole subject thoroughly. If members can
have neither of these helps, then the contents of individual libraries
must be discussed, and a subject must be selected which needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> few books
to work with. It is to be noted that a good general reference book will
be found most useful, even if a practical subject is finally decided
upon.</p>

<p>One of the great dangers a new club has to face is the ambitious
tendency to begin with some abstruse, difficult subject rather than with
a simple one. The Literature of India, or the Philosophy of the Greeks
may be tempting, but even with all the reference books in the world such
subjects are a mistake for beginners. Something should be selected which
is interesting to every one, not too far away from their every day
reading, not too utterly unfamiliar. A country club may like a season on
Bird Study. A village club may find Town Improvement full of
suggestions. A city club can study some American Authors, or the Public
Schools.</p>

<p>If all these things still seem too difficult to begin with, then at
least an Embroidery Club may be founded as the very simplest foundation
possible, the members to come each week with their fancy work and listen
to one member who reads aloud something entertaining. This may do for a
first season, and the second, a study subject may be taken up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes where there is no library at hand, a Magazine Club makes a
good preliminary step to larger things. Members tell a chairman what
magazines they take, and agree to have them at the home of the chairman
one day each week or fortnight. She will look them over and divide the
contents into several parts, travel, biography, essays, stories, poetry,
and so on. Then she will portion out among the members parts of the
programs; one meeting may be on travel only, a second on essays, a third
on poetry, three or four members reading selections from articles on
these. Or, the programs may be varied by combining two or more subjects.
This, too, makes a good training for a serious study in a second year,
especially if a discussion of the subjects becomes a regular part of
each meeting.</p>

<p>Clubs which have gone beyond these two early stages of development, or
which have never been compelled to pass through them, may begin work
with some literary topic. A Year of Biography, covering the lives of
great men and women of America or England, is a good first subject, with
plenty of material. The writings of Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe and others
of the same period, is another. Or, the novels of one or two great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
writers, George Eliot, Thackeray and Dickens, are always delightful,
especially with readings from their novels.</p>

<p>Often clubs will find it a good plan to alternate some study subject one
month with a miscellaneous topic the next, by way of variety. Current
topics, too, are well worthy constant study, and these can be used as a
sort of prelude to any regular program.</p>

<p>Musical clubs are usually limited to a few members, except in cities,
but this is by no means necessary, for numbers of women love to listen
to good music who can neither play nor sing, and perhaps they can
contribute their share of work by writing or speaking of the lives of
the composers.</p>

<p>Clubs interested in practical themes may take up civic questions,
municipal reforms, or children's courts, or cleaning up their town, or
studying factories, or labor laws. There is an excellent magazine called
The Survey which deals with all these topics, and suggests many more on
the same lines.</p>

<p>Chairmen sometimes find real difficulty in making out club programs,
puzzled how to divide a subject into its best points, and subdivide each
of these general topics into others, for individual papers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best plans is always to look up any subject in the
encyclopedia, first of all. It is surprising how much help one can get
there, for history, art, literature, politics and everything else can be
found. Then next, the public library is to be consulted, its card
catalogue looked over, and the books drawn out, or at least glanced
through for suggestions. Magazines sooner or later seem to have articles
on everything, and the library will offer also books of reference to
these. In case the subject is historical, a good high school history may
be consulted, for in the table of contents the main divisions are all
clearly given. A chairman can write down the outlines of all she gleans
from these varied sources and then select from them the general lines of
study and fill these in.</p>

<p>Sometimes when there is no library at hand, a school teacher can help
one out with suggestions, or perhaps a minister may have books on the
subject selected. Or, by writing directly to the state librarian books
may be borrowed of him. Clubs which have a small yearly fee sometimes
buy a book or so a year and keep them as a nucleus of a library.</p>

<p>As to writing club papers, there personality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> comes in, and education
and training, and these give a certain individuality of method of
treating a subject. But even here members can follow out certain
definite directions.</p>

<p>Suppose, to make the matter concrete, that some one wishes to write a
paper on Ruskin, and does not know exactly how to go to work; here is a
general plan:</p>

<p>First, of course, she should read something on his life,&mdash;a book, an
article in a magazine, or anything she can get, and the more she can
read the better paper she will write. Next she should divide her subject
into its parts; in this case there might be three: Ruskin's life; his
work; his influence.</p>

<p>The first topic would cover his home, his early education, the influence
of his mother, and his gradual growth into his place in the world.</p>

<p>The second would take up what he did; his travels, his interest in
painting, architecture, economics and sociology; his friends, his
controversy with Whistler and its outcome, his contact with Oxford, and
the books he wrote.</p>

<p>The third would be a resum&eacute; of what Ruskin actually accomplished; of the
value of his work to society, and his influence on social problems; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the question would be raised, Are his views considered sound to-day?</p>

<p>Such a paper, illustrated by brief readings, would be of a certain
value, for it would be clear, concise, and full of matter which would
probably be fresh to many club members; and any subject may be treated
in the same general way; one has only to choose one on which plenty of
material can be found, then read everything to be had on it, make out an
outline of three or four topics covering the whole and take these up one
by one, illustrating with anecdotes, quotations and the estimates of
others, and the paper is sure to be interesting. What should never be
done is to write a paper without making an outline; the result of that
is vagueness and repetition.</p>

<p>The value of a discussion after a paper cannot be over-estimated. One
joins a club not so much to acquire information, because that can be
done by reading books at home, but rather to learn to express oneself
readily and intelligently. This is why in planning a club it is best to
emphasize the two points; first, that members must talk over the
subjects at the close of each meeting, speaking briefly and always to
the point; and second, that papers should not be too long, or too
heavy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> but full of matter, interesting, and above all, suggestive.</p>

<p>Debates are always of value to club women, for as we know too well, they
are not naturally logical; debating soon shows one how easy it is to
think in a hazy, indefinite way, and how difficult to say clearly and
concisely what is to be said.</p>

<p>It will be necessary, of course, to learn the accepted methods of
debating, and know how to present the points of the argument
progressively and with a climax, as well as to anticipate the points
likely to be made by the opponent. Each side must also be limited as to
time.</p>

<p>As to the subject of a debate, it is a safe rule to choose the concrete
rather than the abstract, a large subject rather than a limited one, and
one of general interest. There should also be two well defined sides,
rather than something accepted by everybody. Such things as the views of
some writer on socialism, or the permanency of the work of a well-known
novelist or poet, or political, but not partizan, questions are always
acceptable.</p>

<p>To make club work successful year after year it should be remembered
that a club is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> university; that it should not be scholastic, but
full of human interests. Tastes of members vary, and so the subjects
selected should be attractive, fresh, and stimulating. In a large club
there may be committees on different subjects, art, civics, child study
and the like, each one a little club in itself, meeting weekly, and the
whole club can gather once a month and the committees in turn present a
program on their special subjects, and so every member be satisfied. As
years go by it will be found that members grow to like subjects other
than those they began with, and more general work will be taken up.</p>

<p>Last of all, to have a successful club it is essential that there should
be no members who are mere listeners. Each woman actually has something
to contribute, if only in a very quiet way, and a good chairman of a
program can find out what this is; the little talent may take shape in a
paper, or a talk, or a part in a discussion, or some music, or only a
quotation or a reading. But a club is worth just as much to a member as
she puts into it, and no more. Any woman who is not willing to do
something in the way of real work should drop out and give some one else
the place which she occupies but does not fill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Two methods are followed in the programs offered to clubs in this book.
First, a year's work is divided up into ten meetings with four or five
papers suggested for each meeting with readings and bibliography.
Second, the year's work is again divided into ten meetings, but it is
left to clubs to choose from the material furnished how many papers
shall be written and what their titles shall be. The material offered in
either case is sufficient for twenty meetings or more; indeed, in some
cases, one theme might be expanded for the work of several years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

Gayley: Representative English Comedies. H.&nbsp;A. Clapp: Reminiscences of a
Dramatic Critic.</p>

<p>The immense improvement in the art of staging plays in this period is an
excellent topic for one paper. The famous actors also may be studied:
John Kemble, Edmund Kean, Macready, and Helen Martin (Lady Faucit), for
the earlier years; the Bancrofts, the Kendals, and Beerbohm Tree, for
the later. Sothern's great success as Lord Dundreary, Macready's visit
to the United States during the Civil War, and the popularity of Irving
and Terry are worthy of consideration. Particular mention may be made of
plays other than Shakespearean, in which Irving and Terry appeared: The
Bells, The Lyons Mail, Faust, and Tennyson's Becket. Read from Terry's
recently published biography. The history of Drury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> Lane and Covent

Teuton Studies.</p>

<p>Goethe has been called the idol of the German people, and the major part
of this program may well be devoted to him. Carlyle's essay on Goethe is
a famous piece of writing, and the life by Lewes is as interesting as a
novel (see the Everyman's Library). Follow the third paper with a
reading from J.&nbsp;G. Robertson's Schiller after a Century. A closing talk
might point out the sentimental character of the early German dramas as
contrasted with the realism of those of to-day. Reference should also be
made to the symbolic plays.</p>

<p>If possible, have an additional paper on some of the interesting French
actors: Coquelin, Mounet-Sully, Rejane, and Bernhardt. Another and
briefer paper may discuss French dramatic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> criticism, easily the most
brilliant of our time in the whole world of letters. Sarcey, Claretie,
Doumic, and Legouv&eacute; are among these well-known names. Have some one
speak of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise and its influence on French drama.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;ENGLISH DRAMA OF TO-DAY</h4>

<p>1. <i>Pinero</i>&mdash;His early style as shown in The Profligate, The Amazons,
and Trelawny of the Wells. The important change in his methods revealed
in The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, and His House in Order. The problem play
in English.</p>

<p>2. <i>Henry Arthur Jones</i>&mdash;Study of The Silver King, Saints and Sinners,

Stage in London.</p>

<p>Mention the many plays written rather for pure literary purposes than to
be acted. Notice those especially of Tennyson, Browning, Swinburne, and
Stephen Phillips. An important factor in the English stage is the
censor, who must pass judgment on all plays before they are acted. Mark
the effect of this in excluding many French plays from England. Note the
relation between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the modern English novel and the drama as illustrated
in The Prisoner of Zenda, The Little Minister, The Seats of the Mighty,
Vanity Fair (called Becky Sharp as a play), The Eternal City, The Garden
of Allah, etc.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;IBSEN</h4>

<p>1. <i>His Life</i>&mdash;Hard youth. Connection with the theater. Struggle to gain
a hearing. Publication of Brand. His pension and financial independence.
Life in Rome. Life in Germany. Change from poetry to prose. His
friendships. His death and public funeral.</p>

<p>2. <i>His Temperament and Its Influence on His Writings</i>&mdash;Realism,
originality, revolt against conventions, individualism, pessimism,
irony. Views of woman. Is Ibsen critic or prophet?</p>

<p>3. <i>Influence of Ibsen on Modern Drama</i>&mdash;His technical skill, daring,
problem plays. Are Ibsen's themes suited to the stage and the average
audience? Should the theater preach or amuse, or both?</p>

<p>4. <i>Study of Three Plays</i>&mdash;Peer Gynt, The Pillars of Society, A Doll's
House. Analysis of plot, description of chief characters, and readings.</p>

<p>5. <i>Study of Three Plays</i>&mdash;Ghosts, The Wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> Duck, Hedda Gabler.
Analysis of plot, description of chief characters, and readings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Brandes: Henrik Ibsen. Gosse: Ibsen. Bernard Shaw:
Quintessence of Ibsenism. Moses: Ibsen, the Man and His Plays.</p>

<p>Ibsen takes a place to-day with the philosophers as well as the
dramatists. In fact, the most interesting aspect of his work is his
relation to social thinking and the revolt against conventions. It would
be interesting to compare views on the points suggested. In what
differing ways do Ibsen's plays affect the club members?</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;BERNARD SHAW AND THE IRISH MOVEMENT</h4>

<p>1. <i>Life of Bernard Shaw</i>&mdash;Dublin. London. Beginning of serial
novel-writing. Fabian Society. Help of William Archer. First play:
Widowers' Houses. The Philanderers. Mrs. Warren's Profession (rejected
by the censor).</p>

<p>2. <i>Shaw's Successful Plays</i>&mdash;Arms and the Man. (Mansfield's rendition.
Musical version: The Chocolate Soldier.) Candida. You Never Can Tell.
The Devil's Disciple. Captain Brassbound's Conversion. Man and Superman.
Showing up of Blanco Posnet. Fanny's First Play.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>Bernard Shaw's Qualities</i>&mdash;His mannerisms and style. His attitude
toward social conventions. His socialism. His attitude toward religion.</p>

<p>4. <i>William Butler Yeats</i>&mdash;Dublin. Encouragement from Oscar Wilde.
Stories and verse. Plays: Land of Heart's Desire; Diarmind and Grania;
Cathleen in Houlihan. Influence of Blake, Shelley, and Maeterlinck.</p>

<p>5. <i>Synge</i>&mdash;Riders to the Sea. Well of the Saints. Playboy of the
Western World.</p>

Chesterton: Bernard Shaw. H.&nbsp;S. Krans; Wm. Butler Yeats and the Irish
School. J.&nbsp;M. Synge: Works (4 vols. Dublin, 1910).</p>

<p>A supplementary paper may be written on the question, Has Shaw a
positive message of any importance, or is he merely a negative critic?
In addition there may be selections from his plays, showing his wit and
clever satire. The amusing comedy, You Never Can Tell, may be read, the
parts being taken by members of the club. Notice also the appearance in
America of the Irish Players under the management of Lady Gregory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h4>IX&mdash;MAETERLINCK</h4>

<p>1. <i>Life</i>&mdash;Early life in Ghent. Paris, 1887. Influence of Villiers de

Temple. The Double Garden. Death.</p>

<p>3. <i>Plays</i>&mdash;The Blind. Pell&eacute;as and M&eacute;lisande. Aglavaine and S&eacute;lysette.
Monna Vanna. Joyzelle. The Blue Bird. Analysis of these plays and
readings from them.</p>

<p>4. <i>His Place in Literature</i>&mdash;What is the meaning of his mysticism and
his symbolism? What is his position with regard to religion? Is his
optimism philosophically justifiable? Compare Maeterlinck with Bernard
Shaw as to difference in spirit and method.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Edward Thomas: Maeterlinck. Arthur Symons: The
Symbolist Movement. E.&nbsp;E. Hale, Jr.: Dramatists of To-day.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck's ch&acirc;teau is especially interesting: a medieval structure
with a great court. It was here that one of his leading plays was given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
first, before a large company of his friends, with Madame Maeterlinck in
the part of the heroine. No scenery was used, but the action took place
in different rooms and in the court. Reference to this may be found in
some of the magazines of the time.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;THE AMERICAN DRAMA</h4>

<p>1. <i>William Dunlap (1798-1815), "Father of American Drama"</i>&mdash;His
numerous plays. Influence of Kotzebue. Study with Benjamin West.</p>

<p>After this program have a discussion on the question: Are women
responsible for the character of the modern drama? Take up also women's
theater clubs, designed to pass judgment on new plays. Does the weight
of their expressed opinion influence the management? On the whole, are
the morals of the drama improving?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Our Own Country</span></h3>

<p>In studying American history it is best to disregard the natural
divisions of decades and centuries and take it up by periods; programs
on these may cover as many meetings as necessary. The books suggested
from time to time may be read at home, or aloud in some of the meetings.
One good reference book which all members can use is John Fiske's
History of the United States for Schools. It has maps, questions, and
other helps. The first period is that of</p>

<h4>I&mdash;DISCOVERY</h4>

<p>Begin with the stories of the voyages of the Norsemen across the sea.
Are these considered historically true to-day? Follow with the three
voyages of Columbus, what he accomplished and where he failed. Americus
Vespucius and the Cabots come next, and the subject of the Spanish
explorations in the South, particularly in Florida.</p>

<p>Ponce de L&eacute;on, Coronado, and De Soto are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> all fascinating topics for
brief talks. The Huguenots made one settlement in Florida of peculiar
interest, and this is written of in a novel called Flamingo Feather, by
Munroe.</p>

<p>The period ends with the discovery by the French of the Canadian country
and the establishment of the fisheries in Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Read Francis Parkman on Champlain and the wonderful stories of the
Jesuit missionaries on the St. Lawrence and the lakes.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;COLONIZATION</h4>

<p>1. The London Company is responsible for the settling of both the South
and the North. Begin with the study of Virginia, the history of Sir
Walter Raleigh and John Smith. Then give plenty of time to these
important topics: The founding of Jamestown, the different governors and
their policies, the Indians and their relations to the colonists, the
beginning of slavery, the raising of tobacco, and the coming from
England of indentured servants. Read Mary Johnston's To Have and To
Hold, which gives an excellent picture of the times.</p>

<p>Note the changes in the colony when Charles I. came to the throne and
the cavaliers came over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> bringing something of luxury with them. In
closing the period mention Bacon's rebellion. Read from John Esten
Cooke's Virginia: a History of the People, and also White Aprons, by
Maud Wilder Goodwin.</p>

<p>2. The northern branch of the great English trading company was called
the Plymouth Company. Of the many sea captains who came over to explore
and sometimes to try and settle, Bartholomew Gosnold accomplished the
most; he found Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, and made a short-lived
colony. John Smith came also, and gave the country the name of New
England.</p>

<p>At this point take up the subject of the Puritans in England, and what
brought them to America. Read of the <i>Speedwell</i> and the <i>Mayflower</i>,
the voyage of the latter and the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. Have a
paper on the first winter with its hardships, and other papers on the
great men of the colony, Governor Carver, Governor Bradford, John
Winthrop, William Brewster, and Miles Standish. Study the topic of the
founding of churches and schools, the relations with the Indians, and
the establishment of new settlements, through Massachusetts and beyond.
Read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> S.&nbsp;G. Fisher's Men, Women, and Manners in Colonial Times, Mrs.
Austen's Standish of Standish, and Longfellow's Miles Standish.</p>

<p>The religious difficulties of the times deserve special notice, because
of their results; read the stories of Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson,
and Thomas Hooker. The work of John Eliot for the Indians should not be
forgotten, nor the rise and spread of witchcraft; on this last read Ye
Little Salem Maid, by Hopkins. Close the period with King Philip's War,
and notice how many colonies now existed.</p>

<p>3. The Dutch of the early seventeenth century were among the most famous
navigators of the world, and the East India Company, founded by them,
sent out ships all over the seas. One of these, the little <i>Half Moon</i>,
commanded by an Englishman in their employ, Henry Hudson, sailed all
along the northern coast, and up the Hudson River as far as Albany.
Others followed him; the New Netherlands Company was organized for
trading in furs, and little settlements were made by them. In 1626 Peter
Minuit, the Governor, bought Manhattan Island from the Indians for less
then twenty-five dollars in beads and ribbons, and founded New
Amsterdam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>From the beginning this colony prospered. Peter Stuyvesant was its most
famous figure, but the whole history of the life of the patroons is well
worth reading. The colony passed into the hands of the English, and was
renamed New York, but the people remained Dutch for many years. Irving's
History of New York and Amelia Barr's Bow of Orange Ribbon give a good
idea of the time.</p>

<p>4. The founding of New Jersey and Maryland come next in order, and the
struggles between Catholics, Puritans, Episcopalians, and Quakers for
supremacy, with the work of Lord Baltimore and Calvert, and the
intervention of Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>The story of the peaceful founding of Pennsylvania by William Penn
follows in 1681, and this, with the settling of the Carolinas and
Georgia, may be taken up rather briefly. The coming of Germans, Scotch
Highlanders, and Scotch-Irish to these southern colonies is to be
mentioned. The war between England and Spain affected the relations
between the Spanish settlers of Florida and the English of Georgia, and
led to trouble. Under Governor Oglethorpe the power of Spain in America
was overthrown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject of the opening up of the Mississippi Valley should be
studied by itself. The story of La Salle is as interesting as any novel;
read Parkman's La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR</h4>

<p>This began in Canada under the famous Governor Frontenac, who came down
to conquer New York, and extended throughout the North, the middle
colonies, and the Mississippi Valley. There might easily be a set of at
least three meetings on this theme. The massacres of the Indians,
especially that at Deerfield; the siege of Quebec; the capture of
Louisburg; the taking of Fort Duquesne by men under George Washington;
the coming of Braddock, and his campaign; the transportation of the
Acadians from Nova Scotia to the South; the history of Sir William
Johnson and the Indians; the fortifications of Fort William Henry and
Ticonderoga; the struggle of Wolfe and Montcalm at Quebec, and the final
overthrow of French power in our country should all be studied, for the
importance of this period of our history cannot be over-estimated. Read
Parkman's histories: Frontenac and New France Under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> Louis XIV.; a Half
Century of Conflict; Montcalm and Wolfe; and the Conspiracy of Pontiac.
Some of Cooper's novels are also good, Leather Stocking Tales
especially; and Thackeray's Virginians may be read in part.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;THE REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>The entire history of the war must of course be gone over, but how
thoroughly will depend on the individual club. At least the causes which
led to it, the great men who guided the nation at the time, and the
results should be made familiar.</p>

<p>Read first of England at the time; of George III. and his ministers; of
their attitude toward the colonies; of the restrictions of manufacture
and trading; of the revenue laws and taxation without representation.
Note the influence of such men as Burke, Pitt, and others.</p>

<p>Take up the patriots in America: Benjamin Franklin, Patrick Henry, Lee
of Virginia, John Hancock, John Adams, Samuel Adams, among others. Show
pictures of the Old South Meeting House and Faneuil Hall of Boston; read
Paul Revere's Ride, and a description of the battles of Lexington,
Concord, and Bunker Hill. Note the establishment of a Continental
congress and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> army, and speak of the fitness of George Washington as the
leader of the American forces.</p>

<p>Read the Declaration of Independence; follow with the struggle for the
control of the Hudson, which occupied the whole of the first year of the
war and more, and includes the battles about New York, with their
retreats and victories; then study the invasion of Canada, the attempt
on the South, the British plan of three Northern armies simultaneously;
the use of Indian allies; the surrender of Burgoyne; the movements of
the fleets; the treason of Arnold; the surrender of Cornwallis.</p>

<p>Other topics for papers or talks may be: Valley Forge; Andr&eacute; and Hale;
the recent discovery of the treachery of Charles Lee; the story of Paul
Jones; the aid of the French under Lafayette; the character of the great
generals on both sides; how the news of the final success of America was
received in England. Read The American Revolution, by Lecky, and H.&nbsp;C.
Lodge's Story of the Revolution; also, The Tory Lover, by Jewett (about
Paul Jones), and Ford's Janice Meredith.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;THE CRITICAL PERIOD</h4>

<p>of our history naturally succeeds the Revolution, when our Government
was in the making. Read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> of the leaders of the time: Washington,
Jefferson, Marshall, Madison, Jay, and Alexander Hamilton. Have parts of
the Constitution read, and study the different aspects of our
Government: the way we choose our President; the houses of Congress and
the Senate; our judiciary. Read the story of Washington's inauguration.</p>

<p>Additional topics are: Shay's rebellion; paper money; the Northwest
Territory; and the home life of the times. Take up the early presidents
in order, with the events of each term. The tariff, the war with the
Barbary pirates, the rise of newspapers, the Louisiana Territory, and
the decrees of France and England about neutral ships are all important.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;THE WAR OF 1812</h4>

<p>Read of the Embargo Act and the refusal of England to repeal her decree;
also of the acts of Napoleon at the time. The battles of the war that
followed were nearly all at sea, and are full of exciting interest, from
the victory of the <i>Constitution</i>, after only half an hour's fighting,
to the very end; one of the most famous is the Battle of Lake Erie, when
Perry sent the historic message, "I have met the enemy, and they are
ours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> Read of the invasion of Canada and the Battle of New Orleans,
and close the study with the Treaty of 1814. A story called Midshipman
Paulding, by Molly Elliot Seawell, gives a good sketch of the time, and
Roosevelt's Naval War of 1812 is excellent for reference.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENTS</h4>

<p>From this point on for several decades, the country slowly increased her
territory, her manufactures, her school system, her trade at home and
abroad. Steam was introduced on boats and railways, and wealth and
comforts grew. Florida was bought for five millions, the Monroe Doctrine
exploited, and several States added to the Union. Slavery gradually
increased in the South, and the cotton-gin was introduced in the North
to weave the raw product there. The Missouri Compromise was one of the
great national issues of the day, and Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and
John C. Calhoun were the leaders in politics. There was a great
commercial panic which led to the settling of our banking laws; the
first telegraphic message was sent; Mormonism was first heard of, and
became important.</p>

<p>The war with Mexico, which began in 1848,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> gave us a great additional
territory. Abolition sentiment rose. The period closed with the
discovery of gold in California. Read Bret Harte's books, Theodore
Winthrop's John Brent, for a study of Mormonism, and Parkman's Oregon
Trail.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE CIVIL WAR</h4>

<p>The various difficulties which led to the great conflict should be
studied in detail in a good history of the times. Among others were: The
Fugitive Slave Law, the Underground Railway, Mrs. Stowe's Uncle Tom's
Cabin, the debates of Lincoln and Douglas, the Dred Scott decision, and
the story of John Brown's raid.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to have a good reference-book with maps of the
campaigns. Perhaps the best book is Battles and Leaders of the Civil
War, written by the great generals, published by The Century Company.
Divide the war into the four years of its continuance, following this
condensed outline:</p>

<p>1861&mdash;Attack on Fort Sumter; call for troops by Lincoln; Battle of Bull
Run; The Trent Affair.</p>

<p>1862&mdash;The <i>Merrimac</i> and <i>Monitor</i>; Battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> of Shiloh; Farragut and the
Battle of New Orleans; Seven Days' Battles before Richmond; Second
Battle of Bull Run; Antietam; Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>1863&mdash;January first, the Emancipation Proclamation; Chancellorsville;
Gettysburg; surrender of Vicksburg; Chickamauga; Chattanooga.</p>

<p>1864&mdash;Grant's advance on Lee; Battle of the Wilderness; Sherman's
Atlanta campaign; siege of Petersburg; the <i>Alabama</i> sunk by the
<i>Kearsarge</i>; Battle of Mobile Bay; fall of Atlanta; Sheridan in the
Shenandoah; Sherman's March to the Sea; Battle of Nashville.</p>

<p>1865&mdash;Battle of Five Forks; Richmond evacuated; surrender of Lee;
Lincoln assassinated; surrender of Johnston; capture of Jefferson Davis;
review of Northern army in Washington.</p>

<p>Take up the condition of the South immediately after the war. Have
papers on the purchase of Alaska, our increase in population, the
crossing of the continent by the railway, and the war with the Indians
in which Custer was killed. Mention the administrations as before, and
close the period with the war with Spain, and describe our new
possessions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<h4>IX&mdash;PRESENT-DAY CONDITIONS AND PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>The various subjects to be studied under this topic stand out
conspicuously: our material wealth; our cities; our manufactures; our
coalfields, forests, watercourses, and other resources; our public
schools and universities; our vocational schools and schools for the
defective; the education of the negro, the Indian, the mountain white;
our railway systems; telegraph, telephone, and wireless communication;
our scientific discoveries; conservation; our art galleries, museums,
theaters, orchestras. Close with discussions of our chief national
problems: immigration, labor, and woman suffrage.</p>

<p>This period should have one program on the physical character of our
country; its great natural beauties in the Yosemite, the Sierras, the
Yellowstone, and the Grand Canyon in the West; the mountains of the East
and South; Niagara, the Hudson, the Mississippi, and our seacoast.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;AMERICAN LITERATURE AND ART</h4>

<p>Our literature sometimes seems to be of small consequence as compared
with that of older countries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> but as a nation we have been occupied
with establishing ourselves in our territory, and have had little time
to give to what may be called the adornments of life.</p>

<p>In our Colonial Period we had a few outstanding historical books like
Bradford's History of the Plymouth Plantation,&mdash;Judge Samuel Sewall's
Diary, and Cotton Mather's Magnalia. Then, also, we had Jonathan
Edwards' great philosophical work on The Freedom of the Will.</p>

<p>In Revolutionary days Benjamin Franklin wrote his autobiography, Thomas
Paine his essays, John Woolman his Journal, and the first American
novelist appeared, Charles Brockden Brown.</p>

<p>Our literature really began with the New-Yorkers, Irving, Cooper, and
Bryant. Then came the New England group, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne,
Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, and the historians, Prescott,
Motley, and Parkman, to which list the name of Harriet Beecher Stowe
should be added. In the South we had Edgar Allan Poe, Simms, Lanier, and
later Cable and Page. The Western country has given us Bret Harte, Mark
Twain, and Riley. Realism has its representatives in fiction in Howells,
James, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> Mary Wilkins Freeman, and in poetry in Walt Whitman.</p>

<p>To-day we have nature writers, including John Burroughs and Stewart
Edward White. We have such essayists as William Winter, Henry Van Dyke,
Agnes Repplier, and Samuel Crothers. We have the poets John Vance
Cheney, James Whitcomb Riley, Madison Cawein, Anna Branch and Josephine
Preston Peabody. We have the historical writers McMaster, James
Schouler, James Ford Rhodes, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and
Henry Cabot Lodge. And among the novelists may be mentioned Winston
Churchill, Margaret Deland, Robert Grant, S. Weir Mitchell, Edith
Wharton, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Ellen Glasgow, F. Hopkinson Smith, Hamlin
Garland, Robert Herrick, Jack London, and Booth Tarkington.</p>

<p>In early days our painters were Gilbert Stuart, Copley, and Benjamin
West; in later years, Inness, Whistler, La Farge, Abbey, and Sargent.
Our sculptors have been Powers, Crawford, Saint-Gaudens, French,
Borglum, MacMonnies, and Potter.</p>

<p>In music we have had MacDowell, Chadwick, Nevin, and Parker; in
architecture, Upjohn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> Richardson, Stanford White, the Hunts, and
Carr&egrave;re.</p>

Abbott: The Home Builder. Holt: The Successful Hostess.</p>

<p>Emphasize in these papers the beauty and charm of a simple, free
hospitality as distinguished from formal and costly entertaining. The
welcoming of a child's playmates after school should be considered, the
opening of the doors to the young people of the neighborhood, the

of congenial groups of people, the drawing in of strangers, and the
spirit of cordiality in church life.</p>

Games for the Playground, Home, School, and Gymnasium. Benson: Book of
Indoor Games for Young People of All Ages. Hoyle's Games (many
editions).</p>

<p>The great point to be emphasized in this meeting is that parents should
deliberately make a place in the home life for amusements, from
childhood up. Discuss: In how many ways can parents and children share
their pleasures, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> how may the spirit of mutual enjoyment be
fostered?</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;VACATIONS</h4>

<p>Discuss these questions: What proportion of one's income is properly
spent in a vacation?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> What is the influence of life in a summer hotel on
parents and children? Is the rest from housekeeping and the change of
life compensation for the drawbacks there? Is the enlarging of the
social circle of one's grown children a duty? Saving versus travel.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;CHILDREN IN THE HOME</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Children's Rooms</i>&mdash;The nursery and its furnishings. Rooms for
the older children: seclusion, comfort, individuality. The playroom and
the workshop.</p>

<p>2. <i>Children and Parents</i>&mdash;The ideal relationship: parents as friends.
When should discipline end and personal freedom begin? Children at
table. The bedtime hour and how to make the most of it. The blessing of

<p>One of the most delightful ways of making home interesting is to
encourage the children to give little plays, illustrated poems and
shadow pictures. Miss Alcott in Little Women gives the outline of one
play which may be prepared easily, and there are others to be had.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;THE FAMILY AND TRAINING FOR LIFE</h4>

<p>1. <i>Training in Work</i>&mdash;The spirit of industry. Faithfulness to tasks.
Making domestic duties interesting. Study of domestic economy for girls.</p>

subject: How best to utilize the home as a training school, and yet to
keep it cheerful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Myths and Folk-Lore</span></h3>

<h4>I&mdash;INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>The first meeting should be given up to a broad presentation of the
whole subject of folk-lore, myths, legends, fairy stories, festivals and
superstitions. One paper should present the universality of myths, the
curious resemblances found among them in races far apart in time and
place. A second paper may give the ways in which they have been
preserved to us. The Egyptians as early as 2800 <span class="smcap">b. c</span>. used the stories
on monuments and in manuscripts. Herodotus and Livy speak of folk-tales;
&AElig;sop's Fables embody many of them. In the Middle Ages story and song
preserved them; and later they were collected. Walter Scott was
especially appreciative of their value; he called them "antiquities,"
and tried to interest people in them in several of his books.</p>

<p>A third paper should deal with the important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> theories held by scholars
as to the origin of myths. The Grimm brothers in Germany, and later Max
M&uuml;ller, held that the similarity of myths proved the common stock and
language of all races; as divisions came the myths passed on from one
country and race to many. Andrew Lang, however, has more recently
developed a second theory, one held to-day by most scientists, that as
all primitive people observe the same phenomena of nature, they invent
much the same myths to explain them, as all pass through the same stages
of culture.</p>

<p>Another paper might notice the growth in the spread of the study of
myths and legends. Since Thorns in 1846 coined the phrase "folk-lore,"
societies have been formed in every civilized land to preserve the old
stories, songs and traditions, and to study them scientifically. Immense
value is placed to-day on their importance as throwing light on history,
literature, religion, and language. One writer says that a full
knowledge of the folk-lore of every nation would be synonymous with the
history of human thought. On the general subject read G.&nbsp;L. Gomme's
Folk-Lore as an Historical Science, Andrew Lang's Modern Mythology, and
the valuable articles in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> the encyclopedias. For readings from the
stories of all nations, see a set of small handbooks published by
Lippincott, called Folk-Lore and Legend.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;THE OLDEST MYTHS, THE HINDU</h4>

<p>In the earliest Western race, the Aryan, we find the simplest myths of
creation and changing nature. They first invented the Sun God, riding in
his fiery chariot, his glowing locks spreading out through the sky. The
demons of darkness revolt against him, and must be overcome. The Rain
God darkens the heavens, and the Dawn Maiden brings the light. From
these first simple ideas grew a large mythology, full of beauty, and of
the local color which we see in all national myths; these are warm and
glowing. Read the translations of some of the stories and hymns. See
Mrs. Poor's Sanskrit and Kindred Literatures, or Warner's Library of
Universal Literature.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;GREEK MYTHS AND LEGENDS</h4>

<p>The mythology of the Greeks is the most beautiful, the most artistic,
and the most perfectly developed of any that we have, and it repays
careful study. The early myths are much like the Aryan; indeed some of
the stories are practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> identical. The sun and moon, darkness,
storm, spring and summer, the ocean and the sky were all personified.
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo in his chariot is the sun; Eros and Psyche are the
coming and going of light and darkness; Demeter, the harvest, has a
daughter Persephone who goes down to the underworld as seed, dies, and
is revived as spring brings back life. Notice how from such first,
simple ideas a whole complicated religious system developed, and how the
original gods and goddesses became so many that earth, air, water, sky,
and all nature were filled with them. See also the gradual decadence of
the system, especially when the Romans adopted it. Compare the myths of
light and darkness with those of other lands. Read from Stories of Old
Greece, by Emma R. Frith, and H.&nbsp;M. Chadwick's The Heroic Age.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;SCANDINAVIAN FOLK-LORE</h4>

<p>In this cold, northern land the same original myths developed as
elsewhere but were altered by the environment. Here the legends are
often terrible instead of beautiful. There are battles of hail and snow,
great ice mountains to be surmounted, gloomy castles to be won. The
spirits of storm, of thunder, of cold, all figure. Animals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> too, are
conspicuous in the stories, especially bears, wolves and eagles. The
gods were stern and awful, rather than lovable. But in spite of this,
there were still some, like the goddess of spring, who had charm, and
some stories which show a sense of humor. Read In the Days of the
Giants, a Book of Norse Tales, by Abbie Farwell Brown. Here are stories
from the Sagas and the Edda, the earliest literature of the North. See
How Thor Went a-Fishing, The Lost Bell, The Three Dogs, and The Meal of
Frothi.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;PERSIAN FOLK-LORE</h4>

<p>The Persian and Arabian folk-lore is really one, and stands quite by
itself. It is unusually rich in well developed stories, many well worth
study. The original myths of light and darkness were typified under the
names of Ormuzd and Ahriman. The Zend-Avesta embodied their religion and
literature, and is full of beauty. Later, however, the early and simple
mythology degenerated into something complicated and almost puerile. The
legends, preserved for us in The Thousand and One Nights, are marked by
Oriental splendor. Often the setting of a story will be in a palace with
wonderful gardens and fountains. We read of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> great merchants, gorgeous
silks, jewels and ornaments; of money, horses and camels; of sheiks,
caliphs, viziers, magicians, and genii. In every respect the stories
differ from those of other lands. Read Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp,
and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, from Andrew Lang's Blue Fairy Book.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;CELTIC FOLK-LORE</h4>

<p>The peoples of Brittany, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland have folk-tales
full of a certain mysticism. They have few nature myths, such as belong
to earlier races, but they have drawn from their own imagination stories
of beauty and charm, which are distinctly poetic, both in substance and
form. Their legends deal largely with fairies, wishing-stones, haunted
glens, and changelings. There are water fairies, some with human souls,
and dwarfs who have homes in caves, and live and work like human beings.
The whole of their folk-tales are filled with these little creatures,
benign or malicious, who are closely in touch with the real lives about
them.</p>

<p>The superstitions of these countries in regard to the reappearance of
the dead as ghosts or spirits of one kind or another, also enter
largely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> into the literature of the Celtic races. This subject, a very
large one, may be taken up here, or later by itself.</p>

<p>There is a delightful book called Fairy and Folk-Lore of the Irish
Peasantry, by W.&nbsp;B. Yeats, and another on the Fairy Legends of Ireland,
by T.&nbsp;C. Crocker. Duncan Anderson has one on Scottish Folk-Lore, also.
Read from any of these, and also a story in Little Classics called The
Fairy Finder, by Samuel Lover.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;FOLK-LORE OF THE SLAVS</h4>

<p>There is much that is curious about the folk-lore of the Russians and
kindred peoples. They have the old, original nature myths, with hero
stories added. There is the same setting as in Scandinavian mythology,
of cold and storm. There are epics in three cycles which embody some
stories almost identical with those of the Greeks. There are, however,
two striking differences between their legends and those of other
countries: one is, that sorcery, witchcraft, spells, exorcisms and
incantations abound; the other is that nearly all tales have folk-music
accompanying them. Fairy stories are abundant and charming, and much
like those of Norway and Sweden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> Read from Myths and Fairy Tales of
Russia, by Jeremiah Curtin, and Russian Folk Tales by R. Nisbet Bain.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;GERMAN FOLK-LORE</h4>

<p>In many respects the folk-tales of Germany are more interesting than
those of any other country. They do not deal with the great, simple
myths, except as they have been transformed into certain fairy tales,
but are centered largely on more recent stories. There are tales of the
Middle Ages, of knights, besieged castles, huntsmen and hermits; there
are Rhine legends, with princesses and giants; there are mining tales of
dwarfs and goblins, and stories of water fairies and forest elves.
Notice the resemblance to the stories of other lands in some of Grimm's
fairy tales. See how closely Peter Klaus is like our own story of Rip
Van Winkle. Read Stories of the Rhine Gold, by Anna A. Chapin, and the
best known stories from Grimm, especially Rumpelztiltskin, Hansel and
Gretel and Snow White and Rose Red.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;FOLK-LORE OF ENGLAND</h4>

<p>All parts of England are rich in folk-tales, festival customs and
legends, and various shires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> have preserved in book form those which are
peculiar to them. In rhymes and jingles, nicknames, proverbs, riddles
and nursery tales we find traces of very early tradition. Frazer's
Golden Bough speaks of May Day customs, Maypole dances, keeping St.
John's Eve and Midsummer Day, as survivals of religious festivals of
great importance. The hero stories, especially those of King Arthur and
his knights, are unusually well developed and beautiful. English fairies
are most human and charming. Shakespeare is rich in allusion to them;
read on this point Shakespeare's Puck and His Folk Lore, by William
Bell, and parts of Midsummer Night's Dream.</p>

<p>In Andrew Lang's Blue Fairy Book all the delightful old fairy stories
are preserved; read Beauty and the Beast, Little Red Ridinghood,
Cinderella, and Jack the Giant Killer. Notice how several of these
stories are considered by some students as nature myths.</p>

<p>Read Kipling's Puck o' Pook's Hill, the modern fairy story, and contrast
with those of older date.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;AMERICAN FOLK-LORE</h4>

<p>The negroes of the South have a complex set of stories of their own,
some with the mark of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> savage ancestors on them&mdash;as is shown in
their fetishism, voodoo, magic and ghosts&mdash;and others which are full of
a quaint humor. Most of the latter are in the form of animal stories,
and have been gathered together by Joel Chandler Harris. Read from
Nights with Uncle Remus, and see how each of the animals mentioned has
its peculiar characteristic, and how the rabbit, who always represents
the colored man, outwits the white man by his cunning. Clubs should make
a point of reproducing some of the old negro folk songs.</p>

<p>The Indians have many myths and legends, which vary in different tribes
and localities. The people of Alaska have legends quite unlike those of
the Mission Indians of California or the Zu&ntilde;i tribes of New Mexico. In
the north, cold, devils, fighting and struggles with animals
predominate; in the south there is more of the spirit of harvest, of
festival and brightness.</p>

<p>The scenes of the legends in general are laid in wigwams and deal with
feasts, love-making, and battles with enemies. There are also many
legends about trees, bees, birds, and fish. The original myths of light
and darkness, flood, and other phenomena also recur. Read Indian Story
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> Song, by Alice C. Fletcher, and F.&nbsp;H. Cushing's Zu&ntilde;i Folk Tales.</p>

<h4>FOLK-LORE IN OTHER LANDS</h4>

<p>In addition to the topics suggested, clubs should study more briefly
than these the tales of other lands. Japan has a delightful set of
tales, turning largely on animals, flowers and spirits. Read Ancient
Tales and Folk-Lore of Japan, by R.&nbsp;G. Smith. Follow with the legends of
China and Corea, both collected, full of originality and interest, with
heroes and nature myths. Hawaii has much local color in her folk-tales,
for volcanic fire often appears. See Hawaiian Folk-Lore by T.&nbsp;G. Thrum.</p>

<p>The myths of Egypt have recently been collected and are quite unlike
those of other lands. They are divided into three groups, one dealing
with the earliest times when simple nature myths occur; the second, when
Egypt developed, and stories of town and country appear; in the third
the stories deal with strangers, ships and sailors. Crocodiles play an
important part, and the atmosphere of heat is always noticeable.</p>

<p>In modern Europe the stories of Spain and Italy and also of Roumania are
to be studied, the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> in the collections made by Carmen Sylva, the
queen. Add to these the subject of gipsy lore, from the book called
Gipsy Folk-Tales, by F.&nbsp;H. Groome.</p>

<p>The subject of superstitions may follow the topics suggested, and
ghosts, reappearances of all kinds, and haunted houses will prove a wide
field.</p>

<p>Hero stories in all lands is also a delightful division of the general
subject. The legends of Havelock the Dane, of Siegfried, of Roland, and
Arthur put them in the class known as the "Fatal Children," or those
whose innate greatness no earthly obstacle can withstand.</p>

<p>See Heroes of Myth, by Lillian L. Price and Chas. B. Gilbert.</p>

<p>One more important and curious topic is that of Were Wolves and Swan
Maidens, as it is called, or the inhabiting of animal bodies by human
souls, which is one of the constantly recurring legends in all lands.
The rescuing of the imprisoned spirit has led to innumerable stories.</p>

<p>The myths concerning the ascent of souls to Heaven is most interesting,
and the legends of the Milky Way and the Rainbow Bridge are poetic and
lovely. The story of Jack and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> Bean Stalk is considered to belong to
the general group.</p>

<p>If there is time, have one meeting on the subjects of dwarfs alone. Note
the differences between black, brown, and white dwarfs, and trolls,
elves, pixies, kobolds, brownies, and goblins. See how closely all are
related to the life of man. Contrast their cleverness with the
invariable stupidity of giants.</p>

<p>In addition to these topics clubs will find the folk-lore of the
Australians, the islanders everywhere, and of savage races, full of
interest. A book just published, called The Fetich Folk of West Africa,
by R.&nbsp;H. Milligan, bears on the last point.</p>

<p>The subject of myths and legends will be found of far greater interest
if each topic is illustrated by pictures. There are many fairy books for
children for which artists have made beautiful drawings, and some
especially lovely, in colors. In studying the Hero stories, get
reproductions of famous pictures of the Rhine, legends, and look up
Abbey's pictures of Arthur and his knights.</p>

<p>Clubs composed of mothers and teachers may take up the subject of
telling fairy stories to children; which ones to tell and which to
omit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> and how to tell them. Hero stories are always interesting to
growing boys, and teachers can suggest to them which are the wisest to
choose. Instead of reading stories and legends at every club meeting it
is well to have them told by some one skilful in the art.</p>

<p>Clubs which wish to study the general subject of folk-lore in a serious
way will find the topic of comparative religions most interesting and
valuable; scholars are everywhere taking it up, and there are many books
upon it, notably Frazer's Golden Bough, already suggested under another
head.</p>

<p>The folk-lore of the ancient Hebrews can be either taken separately or
as a part of this subject; the old hero myths of the Bible, of Samson
especially, will be found delightful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The country about Stratford is constantly referred to in the plays of
Shakespeare. In Henry IV., The Taming of the Shrew, and The Merry Wives
of Windsor there are numerous passages which touch it. The Forest of
Arden is deserving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> of a side-trip, and on the way travelers watch for
the wild thyme, the primroses, the violets, and other flowers mentioned
by Shakespeare. There may be a little tour to Coventry, the quaint old

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Opera</span></h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>It is part of a liberal education to be more or less acquainted with the
lives of our great composers and the operas they wrote; and the subject
is quite as interesting and practical for the women remote from musical
centers as for those near them. There are two books any club can own
which are invaluable; one is called The Opera, by R.&nbsp;A. Streatfield,
which gives a sketch of each composer and an estimate of his work; the
other, Two Hundred Opera Plots, by Gladys Davidson tells the story of
each opera. In addition to these (and of course whatever is to be found
in a good encyclopedia) the score of any opera can be bought at a music
store, and a pianist can illustrate a talk with leading airs; or, if
practicable, one of the modern musical machines can reproduce the voices
of famous singers in their great parts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h4>I&mdash;RISE OF OPERA IN ITALY</h4>

<p>The year's work should begin by one or more meetings on the Rise of
Opera in Italy in the latter part of the sixteenth century. Three little
operas were written, attempting to give the old Greek dramas in a
musical setting. The first public performance of opera as we know it,
however, was given by Peri, in Florence, with his Euridice, to honor the
marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV. of France; this was a sort of
recitative, set to the music of a violin, a guitar, and harpsichord.</p>

<p>Peri was followed by Monteverde, but the latter's production of Orfeo
far surpassed the former's work on the same theme. His orchestra had
thirty-nine instruments, and the effect of the whole was to open a new
world of music. At once opera-writing became the fashion, and in fifty
years all great Italian cities had their schools of opera, and France
had adopted the same ideas. The subjects of all were classical,
allegorical, and pastoral, and to the recitative, alone, were added
songs and arias, and the overture was developed. Some clubs might take
for a year's work the subject of Italy of this period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> adding the study
of art and literature to that of music. A good book to use is Morton
Latham's Renaissance of Music.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;THREE GREAT COMPOSERS</h4>

<p>At this point the history of opera divides, and three great composers
are to be noted. Clubs should have a paper on each, the material drawn
from the encyclopedia.</p>

<p>1. Lulli, though born in Italy, lived in Paris; he wrote twenty operas,
all of which were splendidly produced. He used largely the form of
recitative, but developed the overture, dividing it into a prelude, a
fugue, and a dance.</p>

<p>2. Humphreys, an English composer, was sent by Charles II. to France to
study; on his return he had for his pupil Henry Purcell, still
considered the greatest musical genius England has produced. His Dido
and &AElig;neas is the first English opera.</p>

<p>3. The third great man of the time was Handel, who produced in Hamburg
the opera Almira, a mixture of German and Italian ideas, but made
beautiful by the charming dance music scattered through it. Later he
wrote Rinaldo, and it was brought out with overwhelming success.</p>

<p>Clubs should give an entire meeting to Handel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> Many of his well-known
oratorios have selections which are more familiar than any passages from
his operas, however, notably the Messiah and Elijah.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL</h4>

<p>After the death of Lulli the French school followed him with little
originality until, in the eighteenth century, Rameau gave opera more
rhythm and melody, and added to the orchestration. Then Gluck appeared,
studying first in Italy, where opera had degenerated; he wrote Piramo e
Tisbe, which failed; later he brought out Orfeo ed Euridice, which at
once made him famous. The music is appropriate to the lofty and sad
classical theme, but is relieved with exquisite reproductions of bird
and water music. The whole is one of the great operas. The great song is
Che far&ograve; senza Euridice.</p>

<p>Mozart, though a German by birth, was trained under Italian influence.
His first opera was written when he was twelve years old, and given in
his native town. His greatest work was Don Giovanni, though his last,
The Magic Flute, is best known. But it was his influence over other
musicians, like that of Rameau, which was even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> more important than his
own music. Mozart is one of the most delightful topics for club study.
His charming personality, his friendships, and his life-story are full
of interest.</p>

<p>Cherubini's work, at first cold and formal, developed into dignity and
even grandeur. His finest opera is M&eacute;d&eacute;e, although his one light opera,
The Water Carriers, is also well known.</p>

<p>Beethoven gave one famous opera to Germany at this time, his Fidelio.
The music shows strongly the influence of Mozart, but it is original in
form and beautiful in execution. The Fateful Moment is a good selection
to give.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Weber, a German, was the first to turn from the conventional type of
opera-writing to the romantic. To his solid foundation he added an
exquisite, imaginative glow. After years of struggle he achieved success
in his Der Freisch&uuml;tz. Oberon, his last work, full of fairylike and
charming music, did not succeed. In fact, Weber's greatest
accomplishment was the inspiration he gave others, like Mozart and
Rameau. The overtures to both operas should be given.</p>

<p>Flotow, a German by birth, wrote distinctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> Italian music. His one
well-known opera, Martha, still has a certain vogue, though it is
remembered more for its tuneful airs than for any real merit. The
Spinning-Wheel Song and the Last Rose of Summer are familiar.</p>

<p>Nicolai began his work by imitating Italian music, but later he became
distinctly original and wrote a really excellent comic opera, the Merry
Wives of Windsor, which stands in the first rank.</p>

<p>Schubert wrote many light operas of slight musical value, and Schumann
one of more or less worth, called Genoveva.</p>

<p>Opera-writing now became so popular everywhere that it is necessary to
take it up in its different homes, and to divide the work into that done
in the earlier and later years. The first is:</p>

<h4>V&mdash;THE EARLIER ITALIAN SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Rossini, born at the end of the eighteenth century, knew little of
technical methods, so he followed his native genius. His first great
opera was Tancredi, and this was followed by others in a lighter vein,
notably the Barber of Seville, bright and amusing, and later William
Tell, his finest work, dignified and beautiful. The overture to the last
is one of his familiar melodies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Donizetti, born in the same decade with Rossini, wrote sixty-five
operas; one of the best-known is Lucia di Lammermoor, with its famous
sextet. Lucrezia Borgia, probably his best work, is but seldom given
to-day, but La Fille du R&eacute;giment, a gay, charming little opera, is often
presented.</p>

<p>Bellini, who comes a few years later than the last two composers, wrote
operas famous in their day. I Puritani, La Sonnambula, and Norma, are
all well known. The solo, Hear Me, Norma, is especially familiar.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;THE EARLIER FRENCH SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Meyerbeer, born in 1791, though of German birth, spent most of his life
in Paris. He wrote many excellent operas, even though they were marred
by sensationalism. Robert le Diable, L'Africaine, Les Huguenots, and Le
Proph&egrave;te have all been often given by great singers. Les Huguenots is
considered Meyerbeer's best work, and the duet in the fourth act is of
immense dramatic force.</p>

<p>In contrast with this composer stands Berlioz, born in 1803. His work is
serious, with romantic and delicate touches. He wrote The Damnation of
Faust and Benvenuto Cellini, but his great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> opera is Les Troyens, though
it is scarcely known to the public.</p>

<p>Hal&eacute;vy belongs with Meyerbeer, for one reflected the other. La Juive
appeared before Les Huguenots, and the music of both has much in common.</p>

<p>Just at this time light opera, or <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i>, found in Auber its
greatest composer. He began to write late in life, and his last opera,
The Dream of Love, was produced when he was eighty-eight. His music was
full of gaiety and brightness. Fra Diavolo and Masaniello are familiar,
and the part of <i>Fenella</i> in the latter has been taken by many famous
dancers. Auber has many followers to-day, notably Offenbach, whose Tales
of Hoffman is well known.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;WAGNER AND HIS SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Richard Wagner, born in 1813, is by far the most imposing and most
interesting of all writers of opera. His life and work deserve more than
a passing paper, and clubs are urged to make an entire year's study of
them. At twenty he wrote his first opera, Die Feen, rather a simple
affair; this was distinctly in the Italian manner. Next he tried the
French method, and wrote Rienzi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> with an excellent libretto but showy
music. Later, in poverty in Paris, he wrote The Flying Dutchman, a
picturesque piece of music with beautiful chorus work. After this came
the first of his great operas, Tannhauser, the story of the struggle of
a soul between good and evil. This contains two famous passages, the
Pilgrims' Chorus and the exquisite song to the Evening Star. It is in
this opera that there first appears Wagner's distinctive method, the use
of the <i>Leit-motif</i>, or guiding-theme, which associates one strain or
one set of instruments with one character. This idea had been slightly
used by Gluck, but Wagner developed it.</p>

<p>Five years later came Lohengrin, not as strong a piece of work as its
predecessor, though the prelude is acknowledged to be one of his most
poetic conceptions. None of Wagner's work was successful, however; and
after this point he relinquished the hope of popularity, and determined
to write only what seemed to him great music. In this lofty spirit he
planned Der Ring des Nibelungen. His subject was taken from the old
Norse mythology, the myths altered to suit his purpose. The whole work
is in five parts: the Ring, the Rheingold, the Walk&uuml;re, Siegfried, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the Twilight of the Gods. The plots of these should be read, and such
music heard as can be obtained.</p>

<p>Then came Tristan and Isolde, called the Romeo and Juliet of music, and
after it, strangely enough, followed a light opera, Die Meistersinger,
at once a success; and last, what is considered his greatest work,
Parsifal, which he called a Sacred Festival Drama rather than an opera.
In this he returns to the theme he used in Lohengrin&mdash;the Holy Grail.
The wonderful and touching mystical music must be heard to be
appreciated. For years it has been given at Bayreuth, and musicians from
all over the world have gathered to hear it. It is only of late that it
has been produced elsewhere.</p>

<p>Wagner's life-work was to alter the whole course of modern opera and
give it new dignity and power.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE FRENCH SCHOOL OF TO-DAY</h4>

<p>Gounod, born in 1818, is the greatest composer of French opera of modern
times. His masterpiece is Faust, with its familiar Jewel Song; his
second best work is Romeo and Juliet.</p>

<p>Thomas, the writer of Mignon, full of melody,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> and Hamlet, with its
brilliant and powerful music, is distinctly a follower of Gounod.</p>

<p>Bizet shows in his Carmen the influence of Wagner; the Toreador strain
is its guiding-theme. His work was to raise light opera to almost the
dignity of grand.</p>

<p>Saint-Sa&euml;ns has one well-known work, Samson and Delilah, somewhat
suggestive of oratorio.</p>

<p>Massenet, who died but lately, was full of originality. His operas, The
Cid, Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame, Manon, and Thais, are all to be seen on
the modern stage.</p>

<p>Charpentier in Louise has also struck an original note, and his
orchestration is considered unique.</p>

<p>Debussy has written P&eacute;lleas and M&eacute;lisande, a new opera of great
interest.</p>

<p>Delibes has one charming opera, Lakm&eacute;, founded on the love of a Hindu
girl for an English officer.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;THE LATER ITALIAN SCHOOL</h4>

<p>Verdi, born in 1839 and dying only recently, is the master of the modern
Italian composers. Ernani is typical of his first style, and was
immensely popular. Later he wrote La Traviata, Rigoletto, Il Trovatore,
and Aida. When Verdi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> was an old man he wrote Otello, called his
greatest work. This was followed by Falstaff, full of bright fun.</p>

<p>Verdi's genius inspired many other musicians. Of them all Ponchielli
owed him most; his best opera is La Gioconda.</p>

<p>Puccini, a living composer, also owes much to Verdi; his Manon Lescaut,
La Boh&egrave;me, Madame Butterfly, and The Girl of the Golden West prove his
great promise.</p>

<p>Mascagni is associated with one opera only, the Cavalleria Rusticana,
with its intermezzo which gave it popularity. His later work is
distinctly second rate.</p>

<p>Leoncavallo has followed Mascagni somewhat. His I Pagliacci is his
best-known opera.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;COMPOSERS OF MODERN GERMANY AND NORTHERN EUROPE</h4>

<p>Almost all Germans follow Wagner to-day, but Goldmark in his Queen of
Sheba shows independence, especially in his orchestration. Humperdinck's
lovely Hansel and Gretel has given him a place of importance.</p>

<p>The Bohemian, Smetana, who wrote The Bartered Bride cleverly used his
national airs, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> this and his other operas are typical of his
country.</p>

<p>Glinka, born in 1808, founded the Russian school; his fine opera A Life
for the Czar is well known.</p>

<p>Richard Strauss, a follower of Wagner, is the composer of Salome and
Elektra; the music is rich and complicated, and his talent unquestioned.</p>

<p>In England, Balfe, born in 1808, wrote several operas, the best known
the Bohemian Girl, with its familiar airs. Since his day there has been
little serious work done, but light opera, notably Sullivan's Pinafore,
the Mikado, and others have had great success.</p>

<p>In America we have Horatio Parker, with his recent Mona, a production
full of originality, if one not yet popular; Reginald De Koven, who
wrote the excellent Robin Hood, and Victor Herbert, the author of
lighter works.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In addition to using this r&eacute;sum&eacute; of opera, clubs should make out
programs on popular topics; or there may be one topic used to close each
program.</p>

<p>Subsidizing the opera: shall this be done by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> state, as in Germany;
or by individuals, as in New York?</p>

<p>Cheap opera: is it possible for us to-day? How is it managed in Germany
and Italy? What is the expense of opera in New York, in great salaries,
scenery, costumes, etc.?</p>

<p>Give an idea of some famous opera-houses in Paris, St. Petersburg,
Berlin, Milan, Buenos Ayres, and elsewhere, illustrating with
photographs. Tell of great opera-singers and their careers; mention
Patti, Christine Nilsson, Calv&eacute;, the De Reszkes, Caruso, and others;
have records of such voices, if possible. Discuss the opera music of
to-day: Is it on the whole melodious, or is there a tendency to return
to the old style recitative? Are the airs as marked as those of a decade
ago?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief introductory paper might take up the influence of Roman
classical literature and history on Italian art, and also the effect of
Greek culture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> after the Crusades. The childlike subjects and methods of
the early painters are also of great interest, and what they took from
Byzantine art, and how they were influenced by the study of anatomy. The
luxury of the times and its demands for pictures and statues, the
influence of the extravagance of court life, the Popes as art patrons,
all can be discussed. One entire paper might be given to St. Peter's at
Rome, and another to Da Vinci's great picture "Mona Lisa," and what art
critics have said of it. See also Ruskin's estimates of the Primitives.</p>

others can be obtained, the Perry pictures will do excellently. Those
who have been abroad may compare impressions of different painters, and
especially of the various Madonnas painted by Raphael. Pictures of the
exterior and interior of the Sistine Chapel and of Saint Peter's should
be shown, with colored photographs of the frescoes on the walls and

<p>The Dutch school was the pioneer of modern landscape-painting; show its
influence on Constable and other English artists. The Dutch were
faithful illustrators of peasant and burgher life, and it is interesting
to make a study of costume, furniture, and jewelry as shown by them.
Take up the galleries of Amsterdam, The Hague, and Antwerp, and show
photographs of Van Dyck's Crucifixion, and Rembrandt's Night Watch. At
Haarlem there is a small gallery noted for its paintings by Franz Hals,

critic Winckelmann and his classical influence. This was shown
particularly in Raphael Mengs, in the eighteenth century, court painter
to the King of Poland, and his pupil, Angelica Kauffmann. German art has
been influenced greatly by those who have written about his philosophy,
Lessing, Goethe, the Sehlegels, and others. Mention should be made of

Monkhouse: British Contemporary Artists.</p>

<p>Ford Madox-Brown, who has not been mentioned in the program, should be
mentioned if there is time. The articles in various current magazines by
Ford Madox-Brown Hueffer, dealing with the men of the Pre-Raphaelite
school, are full of incident and humor. The poems of Dante Gabriel
Rossetti and his sister, Christina, should be noticed and several of
them read. Rossetti's wife was the model for many Pre-Raphaelite
pictures. She might be described and the story told of her death and the
burial with her of her husband's poems, subsequently exhumed and
published.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Ten American Women Writers</span></h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>This popular program is given for those clubs who wish something light
and attractive for their year's work. The subject is taken up topically,
and the leading writers only are given; to those names may be added as
many more as are desired. To enlarge the field, add the names of women
poets, essayists, and miscellaneous writers, and take Woman in American
Literature for the subject. See R.&nbsp;P. Halleck's recent book on American
Literature. Or use the one topic of Our Short-Story Writers, and have
that cover as many meetings as programs are needed.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;HISTORICAL NOVELS</h4>

<p>Jane G. Austin used the theme of Colonial days most successfully. She
was saturated with the spirit of the time, and no one can read Standish
of Standish, or Betty Alden without feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> in sympathy with the
Puritans, their romance and hardships. Read from either of these, or
from David Alden's Daughter.</p>

<p>Maud Wilder Goodwin writes, in a delightfully breezy style, of life
among the Colonial Cavaliers, and her White Aprons and The Head of a
Hundred are fascinating; they follow well the books just suggested for
the first meeting. Read from either of the two named.</p>

<p>Amelia E. Barr, though born in England, belongs among American writers.
She has no less than sixty novels to her credit. Her theme has been
largely of the early days in New York, and The Belle of Bowling Green,
The Maid of Maiden Lane, and The Bow of Orange Ribbon are all excellent.
Among her other books are Jan Vedder's Wife and The Black Shilling. Read
from The Bow of Orange Ribbon.</p>

<p>Mary Johnston has covered a large historical field. Beginning in the
early days of Virginia, she took the settling of Jamestown in Prisoners
of Hope and To Have and To Hold; both these are of absorbing interest,
and have remarkable pictures of the Indians of the time. Then comes
Lewis Rand and the settling of the Northwest, and then The Long Roll,
about our Civil War.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> All her work is done in a careful painstaking way,
and is distinctly dramatic. Read from To Have and To Hold.</p>

<p>Add to these the books of Mary Catherwood, about Canada, and those of
Beulah Marie Dix, who has used the wars of Cromwell largely as her
theme; both writers are among our best.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;STORIES OF ROMANCE AND MYSTERY</h4>

<p>Bertha Runkle's The Helmet of Navarre may perhaps stand at the very head
of our romantic novels, for its wonderfully vivid representation of life
and adventure in Paris under her famous hero. It is all the more
remarkable because it was the author's first book, and written when she
was only a girl. Read the closing chapter.</p>

<p>Am&eacute;lie Rives, now the Princess Troubetzkoy, has several romantic novels,
notably The Quick or the Dead and A Brother to Dragons, both written in
an intense, dramatic way; her Virginia of Virginia, while different, is
no less fascinating. Her books have the setting of the South. Read from
the last.</p>

<p>Molly Elliot Seawell has written a great number of books, all carefully
done and of great variety of subjects. Her Sprightly Romance of Marsac,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
which took a three-thousand-dollar prize and is as gay as its title
indicates, has for its foils the more serious The House of Egremont and
Midshipman Paulding. Read from the first.</p>

<p>Anna Katherine Green has many books about the detection of crime, with
complicated plots. Her The Leavenworth Case is her best book; others are
The Mill Mystery, Behind Closed Doors, and The Filigree Ball. Read from
The Leavenworth Case.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;STORIES OF LIFE PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>The greatest problem novel ever written by a woman was Uncle Tom's
Cabin, by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Clubs should give at least one meeting
to this book, studying the times, the character of the author and her
training, as the causes which led to its writing; notice also the effect
of the book upon the nation. It has passed into many other languages
than ours, and has a world-wide fame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stowe also wrote another book with a great theme, The Minister's
Wooing, of early Colonial days and the power of Calvinism in the lives
of the people. Read from both these books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Elizabeth Stuart Phelps (Mrs. Ward) began her work at nineteen with The
Gates Ajar, suggested by the sorrow of the Civil War; this had a
phenomenal success. From that time on she wrote steadily, and each novel
had a problem to present, set out with strong emotion. A Singular Life
is one of her best, and The Story of Avis, Doctor Zay, and The
Confessions of a Wife are all deeply interesting. Read from the first
two.</p>

<p>Margaret Deland has taken up the problems of life in her books with
sympathy, humor and a certain wise and tender philosophy. Her stories of
Old Chester, its delightful people, with their strongly marked
characteristics, and the rector, Dr. Lavendar, who is one of the most
charming delineations ever drawn, are all known to-day to women readers.
Her best novels follow the lines of her other stories, but there is a
power in The Awakening of Helena Richie and in The Iron Woman not in the
short stories. Read from Old Chester Tales.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;STORIES OF SOCIETY AND ITS PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>Edith Wharton studied the problems of society in a great city in her The
House of Mirth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> drawing a faithful if somewhat painful picture. The
Fruit of the Tree and The Valley of Decision present other phases of
social life. Her books are well planned and well written, with a
noticeably subtle touch. Read from The House of Mirth.</p>

<p>Gertrude Atherton also writes of society's problems, but in quite
another manner. The Aristocrats and Ancestors have a distinctly satiric
flavor. In addition to these she has others in quite another vein, The
Doomswoman, and The Conqueror notably.</p>

<p>John Oliver Hobbes (Mrs. Craigie) has some exquisite little books, read
by few, perhaps, because of their peculiar style. She wrote The School
for Saints, The Herb Moon, and The Flute of Pan. Her problems are rather
involved and somewhat attenuated, but on the whole beautifully done.
Read from The Herb Moon.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;STORIES OF HUMOR AND PATHOS</h4>

<p>Ruth McEnery Stuart's early life was spent in Louisiana, and there she
learned to know the plantation negro at first hand. No one has equaled
her in her presentation of his character, with its dependence and
childlike drollery. Her appreciation of his humor is no less marked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
than of his unconscious pathos. Read from A Golden Wedding, Moriah's
Mourning, and The River's Children. In Sonny, one of her loveliest
books, she has taken a poor white as her hero.</p>

<p>Alice Hegan Rice made a large place for herself when she wrote Mrs.
Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. She found that unusual thing, a new setting
for a story, and drew a unique heroine in Mrs. Wiggs. Read from this and
its sequel, Lovey Mary.</p>

<p>Kate Douglas Wiggin (Mrs. Riggs) has several gay stories, a brief series
about Penelope in England and Scotland, and A Cathedral Courtship, quite
as amusing. Her Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is also full of bright
sayings. In The Birds' Christmas Carol she mingles humor and pathos.
Read from Penelope's Progress.</p>

<p>Myra Kelly found in a public school among the poor foreigners of New
York's East Side material for her best book, Little Citizens. It is
written with a keen appreciation of their amusing ways and sayings, and
of sympathy with them. A chapter taken at random will prove delightful
reading.</p>

<p>Carolyn Wells is well known as the author of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> wittiest of verses;
but she has also some books no less attractive. A Matrimonial Bureau, At
the Sign of the Sphinx, and The Gordon Elopement (collaborated) are
filled with freakish situations and clever sayings. Read from the first.</p>

<p>In addition to these, clubs may read Anne Warner's The Rejuvenation of
Aunt Mary, Margaret Cameron's The Involuntary Chaperon, and others; see
also the humorist of several decades ago, Marietta Holley, and her books
on Samantha Allen.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;STORIES OF DOMESTIC LIFE</h4>

<p>Mary Stewart Cutting has been a most successful writer of short stories
about ordinary home life. She is marvelously true to facts, but puts
them in a fresh and humorous way. Her Little Stories of Courtship and
Little Stories of Married Life show us people we all know. Her longer
stories, The Unforeseen and The Wayfarers, have the same good sense, the
same bright way of treating difficulties. Choose selections from her
first two books.</p>

<p>Ellen Olney Kirk writes in a quiet style of delightful people who lead
uneventful lives. Her books are not new to-day, but they are always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
interesting. Select from The Story of Margaret Kent or Marcia.</p>

<p>Alice Brown depicts home life in New England, but always introduces the
element of the unusual, either in plot or characters. There is a certain
strength about all she does. Read from Meadow-Grass or The Country Road.</p>

<p>Kathleen Norris has written a deeply moving story called Mother; it
tells the story of a family of ordinary parents and children with
marvelous fidelity to the commonplaceness of their lives, but it is a
picture of tenderness and an appreciation of what a real mother is and
does.</p>

<p>Margaret E. Sangster's Eastover Parish is a charming study from real
life.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;STORIES OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE</h4>

<p>Louisa M. Alcott's Little Women is a masterpiece. No one has ever been
able to write anything so fresh, so natural, and so wholesome. Her later
books, especially Little Men and Old-Fashioned Girl, are rather in the
same vein, though not the equal of Little Women. Read any favorite
chapter.</p>

<p>Mary Mapes Dodge's greatest literary success was a book for boys, Hans
Brinker, or the Silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> Skates, a fascinating story of Holland. It has
been translated into five languages. Read the "race" from it.</p>

<p>Frances H. Burnett had written excellent books for grown people, like
That Lass o' Lowries, and others, before her Little Lord Fauntleroy
appeared and had instant popularity. Her other children's books were
mostly fairy-tales and simple stories. Read from Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>Laura E. Richards has many books for girls, written with humor and much
sensible suggestion, the latter well hidden. The Three Margarets,
Margaret Montfort, and the Hildegarde stories are all attractive, but
Captain January is most original; read from this.</p>

<p>Josephine Daskam Bacon writes amusingly of both children and parents.
Her Memoirs of a Baby and When Caroline Was Growing are both worth
reading.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Jordan has struck a new note in her stories of convent life.
May Iverson, Her Book and its sequel are full of the absurdities of
growing girls. Read any of the amusing chapters.</p>

<p>Clubs should make a special study of some of the older writers for
girls, especially Sophie May,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> Mrs. A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;T. Whitney, and Susan
Coolidge. Notice also the excellent work of Annie Fellows Johnston, Kate
Bosher, and Inez Haynes Gilmore, and read from their books.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;STORIES OF LOCAL TYPES</h4>

<p>Some of our women writers have used the people of one locality only, or
at least principally; this group may be divided into two programs.</p>

<p>Helen Hunt Jackson, known best as a poet, or as the author of little
essays, has one strong book, Ramona. It is notable not only for its plea
for justice to the Indians, but also for its description of life in
Southern California on remote ranches.</p>

<p>Constance Fenimore Woolson wrote largely of Florida, its everglades, its
orange-groves, its pine barrens. Read from East Angels.</p>

<p>Mary Hallock Foote used the scene of the early mining-camps as her
theme, and has vivid pictures of life and romance there. Read from The
Led Horse Claim or The Chosen Valley.</p>

<p>Charles Egbert Craddock (Mary Murfree) has laid her plots in the
Tennessee mountains. Her heroes are sturdy, uncouth, picturesque
mountaineers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> and her books are noted for the descriptions of scenery.
Read from The Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountain or In the Clouds.</p>

<p>Grace E. King writes of the life of the Creoles in New Orleans. In her
Balcony Stories and Monsieur Motte we have the fragrance and the languor
of the South. Read a Balcony story.</p>

<p>Sarah Orne Jewett was one of the first to choose New England as her
field of work. Her style is peculiarly delicate and refined. She wrote
of the people with truth and sympathy, without a touch of satire. A
White Heron and The Country of the Pointed Firs are among her beautiful
stories; read from the latter.</p>

<p>Ellen Glasgow has laid the scenes of her stories in the South, largely
in Virginia. Her themes are unusual and worked out in a broad, unhurried
way. The Voice of the People, The Deliverance, The Battle-Ground, and
Ancient Law are all worth reading. Select from The Deliverance.</p>

<p>Helen Martin in Tillie, A Mennonite Maid and Elsie Singmaster in several
stories have both taken the quaint Pennsylvania Dutch to write of, with
their remoteness of life from the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h4>IX&mdash;SHORT STORIES</h4>

<p>Of late years, short stories, largely written by women, have crowded our
magazines. It is impossible to choose more than a few for a program, but
club-women may add to those suggested all their favorites, and bring in
short stories to read at one meeting. In addition to the older writers,
Rebecca Harding Davis, Harriet Prescott Spofford, and others, take the
following:</p>

<p>Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, though the author of several novels, is perhaps
our greatest short-story writer. Her characters, especially those drawn
from New England rural life, are reproduced with marvelous fidelity. She
understands their foibles, their oddities, and writes of them with
fidelity and humor. A New England Nun is called her best book; read any
story from it.</p>

<p>Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, the author of The Perfect Tribute as well
as many stories of a lighter character, writes charmingly.</p>

<p>Margarita Spalding Gerry in The Toy Shop has something really unusual,
both in theme and treatment.</p>

<p>Octave Thanet (Alice French) vivaciously represents plain people; her
Missionary Sheriff and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> Stories of a Western Town are well known; read
from either.</p>

<p>Add to these names those already given under other heads for this
outline: Sarah Orne Jewett, Alice Brown, and Mrs. Cutting.</p>

<p>As has already been suggested, the year's work may be expanded into a
complete study of American women writers. If this is done, begin with
those of early years: Lydia Maria Child and Margaret Fuller; add to them
our essayists, Helen Hunt Jackson, Agnes Repplier, Vida Scudder; our
poets, the Cary sisters, Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Larcom, Emily Dickinson,
Edith Thomas, Celia Thaxter, May Riley Smith, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Emma
Lazarus, Helen Hunt Jackson, and Josephine Preston Peabody, and Anna
Branch, and our miscellaneous writers, who have written biography,
essays, stories, and practical books: Alice Morse Earle, Marion Harland,
Kate Upson Clark, Mary Heaton Vorse, and Margaret E. Sangster. Women
journalists might also be an additional subject, and women editors, to
cover the entire field of women in letters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

State Cornell Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 256).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The town water-supply has immense interest; study its relation to the
disposal of sewage; the ice-supply, the use of filters, bottled water,
and the like. Cleaning up and beautifying the back yards of a town,
planting vines, removing unsightly buildings, making gardens and having
window-boxes may be expanded into more than one paper. The village
common, the drinking-fountains, the band-stand, the use of refuse-boxes
in public places, may be discussed.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;THE WORKING-PEOPLE'S HOMES</h4>

<p>1. <i>Existing Conditions</i>&mdash;The various subjects of air, light,
water-supply, sanitation and adequate fire-escapes may be brought up for
careful consideration.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Model Tenement</i>&mdash;Plans, profit to the owner of tenement
property, management, rules for tenants (cleanliness, promptness of

DeForest and others: The Tenement-House Problem. F.&nbsp;C. Moore: How To
Build a Home.</p>

<p>Discuss the subject of the model towns. How satisfactory do the tenants
find the system of leases and regulations? Show pictures of the Garden
Cities of England and the model tenements of Berlin. Take up the merits
of building-and-loan associations and buying homes on the instalment
plan. Shall we employ an architect for the small home, or are published
plans practical?</p>

<h4>III&mdash;FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Industrial Age</i>&mdash;The introduction of labor-saving machinery in
England in the eighteenth century. Enormous development in the present
day. General effect on the laboring class.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Factory System and Human Life</i>&mdash;Overcrowding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> and lack of air
and light. Unprotected machinery. Danger of fire. Inadequate
fire-escapes and exits. Bad sanitation. The sweat-shop. Monotony of
tasks and overlong hours of work. The labor of women. Child labor.</p>

<p>3. <i>Model Conditions in Factory Life</i>&mdash;The building: air, light,

Insurance against accident, old age, and death. The lunch-room. The
factory doctor.</p>

<p>4. <i>Local Ideals</i>&mdash;Conferences with employees. The cultivation of social
sentiment in the employing class. Beautifying the factory grounds.
Associations among employees: recreation, social, mutual benefit.
Holidays and Sundays. The children in factory homes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Clarke: Effects of the Factory System. Spahr:
America's Working People. Wright: The Factory System as an Element in
Social Life.</p>

<p>At this meeting there should be a presentation of the fine conditions
existing in certain great manufactories and publishing-plants where the
employers and the employed are working for the same high ends; pictures
may be shown of gardens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> recreation-grounds, lunch-rooms and the like;
abundant material may be found in various magazine articles. The
question of old-age pensions should be discussed. A practical outcome of
this meeting may be the appointing of a permanent committee to better
local conditions.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Place of the Public School in American Life</i>&mdash;Beginning of the
public school in colonial days. Relation of the school to citizenship.
National sentiment. The flag and the school. The public school and the
foreign child.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Modern Curriculum</i>&mdash;Multiplication of subjects (manual training,
cooking, sewing, music, etc.). A discussion of the merits of the system:
thoroughness versus variety.</p>

clubs. Is the public exhibition desirable?</p>

<p>5. <i>School Sentiment</i>&mdash;Interscholastic athletics and debates. The alumni
association. The commencement exercises and annual banquet. The return
of distinguished graduates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Dewey: The School and Society. Butler: The Meaning of
Education. The International Educational Series. Reports of the United
States Commissioner of Education.</p>

<p>A discussion may be planned on home work: How much shall be expected and
arranged for by the parent? When is it best done? Emphasize the
importance of having the parent closely in touch with the child's work,
familiar with his reports, and constantly in conference with the
teacher. Notice the importance of the work of the truant officer. If
there is no gymnasium provided by the school, can the parents combine
and make one? In a large city, can there be a roof-garden for
recreation?</p>

<h4>V&mdash;AMUSEMENTS OF THE TOWN</h4>

<p>1. <i>Necessity of Recreation</i>&mdash;Change in our point of view: the old ideas
contrasted with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> new. Read from the chapter on Recreation in

ideal of culture. The ideal of healthful interest for young people. The
ideal of clean amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Luther H. Gulick: Popular Recreation and Public
Morality (Sage Foundation). Hartt: The People at Play. W.&nbsp;S. Jevons:
Amusements of the People.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>This is one of the most important programs of the year, and deserves
special preparation and study.</p>

<p>The modern tendency is to plan everywhere for clean, wholesome
amusements for old and young, and the woman's club can co&ouml;perate with
the mayor, school trustees, and intelligent men and women, to carry out
their plans.</p>

<p>Discuss especially what has been done to provide a substitute for the
attractions of the saloon; the dangers and the value of the
moving-picture show, and how far there may be a public sentiment created
for the regulation of these and other amusements.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;THE TOWN CHILDREN</h4>

<p>1. <i>Town versus Country for Children</i>&mdash;Discussion of the advantages and
the disadvantages of each. How to make the most of town life for

Musical classes, the children's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> chorus, the children's orchestra.
Pantomimes, plays, and dances.</p>

<p>4. <i>Public Provision for Children</i>&mdash;Museums for children. Public
playgrounds. The children's room in the public library. Exhibitions of
pictures for children. Illustrated lectures in the public school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;G. Stanley Hall: Educational Problems. L.&nbsp;H. Gulick:
Children of the Century. Mangold: Child Problems. Jekyll: Children and
Gardens.</p>

<p>Women's clubs should definitely interest themselves in the children of
the city or country, and do for them what is not done by the public. The
value of playgrounds and gardens in cities, and of children's classes in
sloyd or manual training in the country, cannot be over-estimated.
Musical training is also valuable, not merely for its esthetic results;
and children's choruses, with cantatas and oratorios, may be most
interesting. Motion dances and national dances are easily taught, the
latter especially in towns and cities where different nationalities are
represented in the population.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS</h4>

<p>1. <i>Civic</i>&mdash;The court-house: the proper architecture&mdash;simplicity and
dignity. Improving an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> old structure. The grounds. Decorations. The
jail: what are the present local conditions? Is improvement possible?
Modern ideas of imprisonment and the housing of prisoners.</p>

<p>2. <i>Useful</i>&mdash;The station: co&ouml;peration between the railway company and
the citizens. Cleanliness, paint, sanitation, lawns, and flower-gardens.
The water-works: decorative possibilities in the plant. Fountains and
flower-beds.</p>

<p>3. <i>Literary</i>&mdash;The public library: the value of a lecture-hall. The
local lyceum. Loan exhibitions. Reading-rooms: importance in the absence
of a library. Making the place attractive.</p>

<p>4. <i>Monumental</i>&mdash;Improvement in public taste. Necessity of a committee
to pass judgment on proposed memorials. Superfluous monuments. Statuary
and tablets. The soldier's monument. The local historical society. The
cemetery: the ideal location, ownership, and control. Trust funds for
perpetual care. Beauty and ugliness in stones. Trees, lakes, flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Mawson: Civic Art. Bentley and Taylor: Practical Guide
in the Preparation of Town Planning Schemes. Ravenscroft: Town
Gardening. Penstone: Town Study.</p>

<p>Much can be done by a club toward improving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> the condition of the local
cemetery; perhaps even by moving it from a place too near the heart of
town to a more attractive and proper site, planting trees and flowering
shrubs, arranging to have grass and flowers cared for, straightening old
monuments, and the like. A paper might deal with the question: How can
women carry out their ideas without antagonizing the town council?</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE TOWN CHURCH</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Church Structure</i>&mdash;A beautiful exterior: simplicity, good taste
in material, outline and color. A beautiful interior: quiet decoration;
window glass, good and bad; low-toned carpet and cushions.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sunday Services</i>&mdash;Dignity and reverence in their conduct. Importance
of music. How shall good music be secured in a small neighborhood? The
chorus choir. Vesper services.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Sunday-School</i>&mdash;Modern methods. The graded school. Prizes and
exhibitions. Young people's work; relating this to the rest of the
church-work.</p>

<p>4. <i>Week-Day Appointments</i>&mdash;Men's meetings: how to get the men to come.
Civic value of men's church clubs. Women's meetings: the church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> aid
society, the missionary society. Young women's guilds. Clubs for girls
and for boys. The Boy Scouts, etc.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Minister's Home</i>&mdash;Should the social life of the church center in
the minister's home? Relation of the minister's wife to her husband's
work. Church ownership of the minister's house; its care and
improvement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;C.&nbsp;A. Wight: Some Old Time Meeting Houses of the
Connecticut Valley. K.&nbsp;L. Butterfield: The Country Church and the Rural
Problem. W.&nbsp;M. Ede: Attitude of the Church to Some of the Social
Problems of Town Life. Ramsay and Beel: Thousand and One Churches. E.&nbsp;C.
Foster: The Boy and the Church.</p>

<p>The question of the use of the stereopticon and moving pictures in
connection with the church should be taken up. Shall the Sunday-evening
services be varied occasionally by a talk on the Holy Land, or famous
paintings of Christ, or the Pilgrim's Progress, or the Passion Play at
Oberammergau? The distribution of the church flowers after services may
be an outcome of this meeting, and a club committee may be appointed to
see that they are taken to the sick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<h4>IX&mdash;CHARITIES</h4>

<p>1. <i>Existing Local Charities</i>&mdash;Their history, character, and condition.
The poorhouse, free beds in hospitals, distributing agencies.
Discussion: What can we do to improve local conditions?</p>

<p>2. <i>Best Methods of Helping the Needy</i>&mdash;Peril of indiscriminate giving.
Self-respect in the poor. Place of the friendly visitor.</p>

<p>3. <i>New Work</i>&mdash;The day nursery, the kitchen garden, the flower-and-fruit
committee, home for the aged, free employment bureau, work centers: the
laundry and the wood-yard.</p>

<p>4. <i>Organized Charity</i>&mdash;Discuss the subject of waste through
duplication. Gathering and distributing information. Co&ouml;peration between
church and other societies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;E.&nbsp;T. Devine: The Practice of Charity. E.&nbsp;T. Devine:
Misery and Its Causes. W.&nbsp;H. Allen: Efficient Democracy.</p>

<p>In cities, one of the most valuable helps in charitable organizations is
the constant meeting of the workers at informal gatherings, when the
larger aspects of the subject are discussed and the various parts of the
work are harmonized. The necessity that all should work sympathetically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
together should be emphasized in a brief talk after this program.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;LOCAL AMBITIONS</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Town Beautiful</i>&mdash;Description of what is being done in cities,
and suggestions thus derived: Washington, Chicago, Cleveland,
Minneapolis. L'Enfant's plans for Washington, and their history. What
Baron Haussmann did for Paris.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Plan of the Town</i>&mdash;Is the location of the best? Can the
situation be changed in any way for the better? Plan an ideal town on
the local site. Value of an outlook for the future.</p>

<p>3. <i>Landmarks</i>&mdash;Give a brief history of the town; and mention the chief
incidents in it, and the names of the principal persons who shared in
them. Suggestions as to public memorials, tablets, and monuments.</p>

<p>4. <i>Specific Improvements</i>&mdash;Removal of unsightly objects and buildings.
Regulation of saloons. Improvement of unsanitary houses. Drainage of
swamps and pools in the neighborhood. The surroundings of the railway
station.</p>

<p>5. <i>Organization</i>&mdash;What committees are needed to help improve the town?
How can such committees co&ouml;perate with similar men's committees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> and
with the public authorities? How can public sentiment be aroused? Value
of an exhibition of plans for ideal towns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;M.&nbsp;M. Penstone: Town Study. A.&nbsp;D. Webster: Town
Planting. H.&nbsp;I. Triggs: Town Planting. Raymond Unwin: Town Planting in
Practice.</p>

<p>This program should be of practical value to the local town, summing up
the meetings that have preceded this, and presenting certain definite
propositions for civic improvements. It might be well to invite some of
the officials of the town to be present and offer suggestions. A
committee should be appointed at the close to take up the specific plans
adopted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Holland</span></h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>No historical study could be of greater interest to clubs than that of
Holland. The story of the rise of the Dutch Republic is more stirring
than any romance. Her army was small, but unconquerable; her navy
successfully fought the navies of far greater nations. Her commerce was
unrivaled; her colonies were planted in unknown countries; her artists
were the greatest of the world at the time. But, most of all, Holland
was wonderful for her great struggle for liberty when liberty was
unknown, and the effects of her victory were world-wide. The English and
American revolutions were founded on hers.</p>

<p>Clubs can use for reference The Story of Holland, by James E.&nbsp;T. Rogers;
Brave Little Holland, by W.&nbsp;E. Griffis; and Motley's stirring book, Rise
of the Dutch Republic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<h4>I&mdash;THE LOW COUNTRIES</h4>

<p>The history of this part of the north began when Julius C&aelig;sar came to
Gaul. At the farthest point lay a huge morass covered with forests
called Batavia, and one race living there, the Friesian, was noted for
its independent, untamed character. Their law declared that "the race
should be free as long as the wind blew out of the clouds," and this
ancient saying has always been the rallying cry of Dutch patriotism.</p>

<p>At first under German dominion, the country became later a part of the
Holy Roman Empire, and was ruled by a prince bishop. Later the Counts of
Holland governed, and after the Crusades, when the feudal system was
perfected, the great towns became practically independent. We read of
magistrates, mayors, and aldermen. The population changed rapidly,
commerce flourished, learning spread, and Holland became famous as the
great cloth market of the world.</p>

<p>Close this period by noting two important points: First, that after the
land had all been cleared and drained the people built dikes and forced
the sea back, so gaining much arable land; second, that the great guilds
of the time had much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> to do with the future history of the country. They
existed among artisans and manufacturers, and, in addition, the curious
guilds of rhetoric gave theatrical exhibitions and had processions, the
latter called Land Jewels, from their magnificence. Motley lays emphasis
on the value of the guilds in keeping alive the sentiment of liberty.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;PHILIP THE GOOD</h4>

<p>In the fifteenth century, Philip the Good of Burgundy, by purchase,
usurpation, and marriage dower, became the head of the Low Countries.
The real rulers of the country were the stadtholders, and the great
cities stood individually rather than unitedly. Read the story of the
war against England under Philip; note the rise of the fisheries and
their immense importance commercially, as well as the beginning of the
Dutch navy in the fishing fleet. Read also in Brave Little Holland of
the curious political parties called the "Cods" and the "Hooks." Notice
the beginnings of the Reformation in other countries under Luther and
Calvin, and have a paper on Erasmus of Holland; contrast his teachings
with those of the other reformers. Read Henry Kingsley's novel, called
Old Margaret, on this time, and also Scott's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> Quentin Durward, and Mary
of Burgundy, by G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;R. James.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;TROUBLE WITH SPAIN</h4>

<p>Passing rapidly through several intervening reigns, we come to that of
Philip the Fair, whose momentous marriage with the daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella of Spain brought the Netherlands into conflict with the
greatest power in the world. Their son Charles, born in 1500, and called
Count of Flanders, became King of Spain and then Emperor of Germany. He
was hard, narrow-minded, selfish, and a religious bigot.</p>

<p>As soon as he realized the inroads Protestantism was making in Europe,
he determined to put it down. He prohibited the reading of the Bible,
just printed in Amsterdam, and established the Inquisition, which in
Holland alone put to death over fifty thousand people. After fifty years
of disastrous rule he abdicated in favor of his son Philip.</p>

<p>At the great ceremony which marked this event three famous persons took
part: Charles himself; the Stadtholder of Holland, William, Prince of
Orange, on whose arm Charles leaned; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> Philip the new sovereign, who
inherited all his father's bigotry, and added a cruelty which exceeded
it.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;ACCESSION OF PHILIP II. OF SPAIN</h4>

<p>It was only a short time before William discovered that Philip had
planned a massacre of all the Protestants of Holland; although himself a
Catholic, he quietly returned home at once and gave warning of the
danger; it was then that he obtained the title of William the Silent.
The Dutch had received Philip in their country, but now, while pledging
loyalty to him, they asked the withdrawal of the Spanish troops, which
so angered the King that he left the country, vowing vengeance. Read
from Motley the account of the memorable scene of the parting between
Philip and William, and also his estimate of Philip.</p>

<p>Philip left behind him Margaret of Parma, his half-sister, as regent.
Holland begged her to suspend the Inquisition. Have a paper on the
banquet at which the petition was presented, and the founding there of
the famous order of "The Beggars of Holland," who did such wonderful
things on land and sea. Close the program with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> a sketch of William, who
now becomes one of the foremost men of history of any period.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;THE WAR</h4>

<p>Philip was determined to uproot Protestantism in Holland at all costs.
He sent there the merciless Duke of Alva with more than ten thousand
picked troops; he established himself at Antwerp, formed the terrible
"Blood Council," pronounced sentence of death on all the people of the
Netherlands, and summoned William to appear before him. Margaret
withdrew from the country; William fled to Germany, and was outlawed;
ten thousand Hollanders escaped to England. William, directing the war
from Germany, placed his brother Louis at the head of the troops; a
great battle, Heiliger Lee, followed, in which by a stratagem the
Spanish were utterly defeated. Declaring himself a Protestant, William
returned and took the field.</p>

<p>Read the story of Egmont and Hoorn and their fate in Motley and in
Goethe's drama. Have selections from these novels bearing on the time:
Lysbeth, by H. Rider Haggard, and Jan van Elselo, by G. and M.
Coleridge.</p>

<p>Alva fought and defeated William at Geta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> and dispersed his army.
Believing victory his, he had a great statue of himself erected at
Antwerp; but twenty-four vessels of the little new navy manned by the
"Water Beggars" turned the tide against him, and at this point the great
struggle really began.</p>

<p>Only the few leading events can be touched upon here, but clubs should
take up the whole wonderful story of the conflict, in many respects the
most interesting war of history.</p>

<p>The seven months' siege of Haarlem, with its heroic defense and final
destruction, was followed by the siege of Alkmaar, when women and boys
helped fight in the trenches; the dikes were cut and the Spaniards
driven out by the sea.</p>

<p>The two sieges of Leyden followed, with their starvation and pestilence;
and at last, when only a handful of people were left, the distant dikes
were cut and the water slowly crept across the fields; then a great
storm arose, and so swept in the sea that the Dutch navy could sail
across the land to the city's relief. Alva left for Spain, and the new
regent and commander, Requesens, came. Soon after the Dutch issued their
Declaration of Independence, July 26, 1581, and later formed the United
States of the Dutch Republic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other governors came to Holland, Don John of Austria and Alexander
of Parma, but neither could bring the Dutch to submission. The siege of
Antwerp followed, and soon after William was assassinated by a Spaniard.
In despair Holland offered the sovereignty of the country first to
France and then to England; both refused it, but Queen Elizabeth sent
men and money. Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earl of Leicester, Miles
Standish, Captain John Smith, and Sir Philip Sidney came, and the last
lost his life on the battle-field.</p>

<p>Maurice, the son of William, now took command, and was called "the
foremost soldier of Europe." It was not long till Spain, weary of forty
years of struggle with an unconquerable people, signed a treaty of peace
and virtually acknowledged Holland's independence.</p>

<p>Clubs should take up the whole story of the relations of Holland and
England and observe how, three years later, when the Armada came,
Holland helped England to meet it. Discuss the bearings of this great
struggle for liberty on other nations: what was really won?</p>

<p>Read of the different sieges from Motley; notice also what he says of
the work of the Inquisition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> and its effect on the resistance of the
people. Read George Ebers' The Burgomaster's Wife and Dumas' The Black
Tulip. There are also two books written for boys by G.&nbsp;A. Henty which
are worth looking over: one, By Pike and Dike, dealing with the siege of
Haarlem, and the other, By England's Aid. Ruth Putnam's life of William
the Silent should be read.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;AFTER THE WAR</h4>

<p>Holland, in spite of her terrible losses by death in battle, by
starvation, and by torture, and the immense destruction of property, and
the cost of carrying on the war, was yet left in a strong position. She
was at once enriched by the coming of thousands of intelligent merchants
and artisans from the south, flying from persecution, and her trade and
colonies were uninjured. The great Bank of Amsterdam flourished, and had
an interesting history. The curious event of the time was the "tulip
mania," a wild speculation which was disastrous to the nation.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;HOLLAND AND PROTESTANTISM</h4>

<p>All over Europe religion and politics intermingled, and it was so in
Holland. The country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> as a whole followed the Calvinistic form of faith,
and this led to internal difficulties. It was really a question whether
Church and State should be united or separated. Maurice, Barneveldt, and
Grotius were the leaders. Barneveldt, a truly able statesman, was
beheaded; Grotius, the famous scholar, escaped from imprisonment to
Paris. Complications arose from the coming of persecuted peoples; the
Albigenses from France, the Waldenses from Italy, and the Anabaptists.
In the end democracy won, religious liberty was assured, and Church and
State were kept apart. At this point tell the story of the Pilgrim
Fathers in Holland, and show how far ahead of the times Holland was in
her religious position.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;TROUBLES BETWEEN HOLLAND AND ENGLAND</h4>

<p>Both Holland and England had colonies in India and elsewhere, and now
their trade conflicted. The antagonism thus roused was increased by the
fact that the Dutch had given shelter to the Stuarts. The English forced
on Holland a two-years' war which was entirely on the sea, and was led
by four great admirals: Blake and Monk on the side of the English, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Tromp and De Ruyter on the side of the Dutch. The story is full of
interest; the result favored the Dutch.</p>

<p>The great political leader, John De Witt, came into prominence at this
period; he was called "The Wisdom of Holland." He had the descendant of
William the Silent educated, and later originated the plan of having him
marry Mary, the daughter of the Duke of York, later James the Second of
England, hoping so to weld the two countries together. De Witt's murder
by the mob in 1672 is a blot on the country's honor.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;THE SECOND NAVAL WAR WITH ENGLAND</h4>

<p>The reins of the government were in the hands of the Stadtholder
William, another prince of Orange; but, in spite of all efforts, war on
account of the colonies broke out. A great naval battle occurred, and
the English fleet was burned. Later, France, aided by England, invaded
Holland, but again the dikes were cut and the foreigners driven away.
Years of war followed, with different countries taking part, and with
Spain, strangely enough, siding with Holland. In a battle in the
Mediterranean, De Ruyter, the idol of his people, was killed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>There was much talk at the time of making William king of the
Netherlands, but just then England took up the project of having him
marry Mary, as De Witt had planned, and this he did. He invaded England,
was received gladly by the people, and was crowned joint sovereign with
Mary in London. King James fled, and the new dynasty was established
peacefully.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;HOLLAND'S LATER HISTORY</h4>

<p>In 1747, when all Europe had been in turmoil, the whole seven provinces
of the Netherlands, which had been loosely connected, united, and the
stadtholder became the real ruler of his people; but dissensions arose,
his powers were curtailed, and at last civil war broke out. The King of
Prussia took part, and Amsterdam was besieged and capitulated. Later
Napoleon came, and Holland was soon only one of his little kingdoms.
Against him, at Waterloo, the Prince of Orange fought with the allies.
After the victory the prince made a triumphal entry into The Hague, and
took the title of Sovereign Prince. The republic, which had existed only
in name for years, ended there, for presently he was crowned as King
William I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Belgium united with Holland in a union which could not last, and a nine
years' war followed, with one memorable event, when Lieutenant Van Speyk
blew up his own ship with all on board, rather than surrender. Belgium
and Holland separated. William I. was followed by William II. and
William III., and the young Queen Wilhelmina, who is the daughter of the
last king. She and her consort are the rulers to-day.</p>

<h4>HOLLAND AND LEARNING, ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE</h4>

<p>There is only one great university in Holland, that of Leyden, founded
in commemoration of the great siege by William the Silent. Learned men
from all over Europe flocked there at one time, and its students
numbered two thousand. To-day there are only a few hundred, as in the
other two smaller universities. But Leyden is still famous for its
museums, among the richest in Europe.</p>

<p>Holland had some notable early printers, among them the Elzevirs, who
stand in the first rank. She had two world-leaders in philosophy,
Spinoza and Descartes, the latter belonging also to France. Erasmus was
the most distinguished of modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> classical scholars, and Grotius
founded the science of International Law. Jakob Cats is Holland's
best-known poet, and Maarten Maartens is the great novelist.</p>

<p>The Dutch have stood foremost in science, especially medicine. They
produced the first fine optical instruments, and they have been pioneers
in navigation and floriculture.</p>

<p>In painting, Holland occupies a place of high distinction. Among the
names of the great painters are those of Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Gerard
Douw, Teniers, Ruysdael, Jan Steen, Hobbema, and Cuyp; and in our own
time, Ary Scheffer, Alma-Tadema, Israels, Mesdag, and Mauve.</p>

<p>Clubs would do well to take a year of study on the last general topic
alone. The history of the men of science and philosophy and the analysis
of the work of the painters are enough to fill easily many programs. Add
to this the study of Holland as a country; its picturesque buildings in
the cities; its canals, bridges, and boats; its windmills; its fishing
towns and their quays and smacks; the great picture-galleries and
museums; the market-places; the peasants there and in the villages, and
their quaint costumes; the life of the court; the curious
out-of-the-world places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> on the islands and in what are called the "dead
cities."</p>

<p>Illustrate programs on these subjects with pictures of all kinds, such
as may be found in De Amicis' book, already suggested. See also G.&nbsp;H.
Boughton's Sketching Rambles and Stevenson's An Inland Voyage. A clever
little story of a trip on Holland's canals is The Chaperon, by C.&nbsp;N. and
A.&nbsp;M. Williamson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Homelike House</span></h3>

<p>This very practical subject for club study is here arranged under ten
topics, but they may be divided into as many more. Numbers one, seven,
and ten may be used separately&mdash;a year's work made out of each one.</p>

<p>Good books for general reference are: The Family House, by C.&nbsp;F.
Osborne; The House, Its Plan, Decoration, and Care, by Isabel Bevier;
and The House Beautiful, by W.&nbsp;C. Gannett. The American School of
Economics of Chicago has some very useful books on its list on the
building and furnishing of homes, and there are hundreds of magazine
articles on these and kindred subjects.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN HOUSE</h4>

<p>Begin in the earliest times with the homes of the cave and lake
dwellers, the reed and wattle huts of primitive man, and the tents of
the nomads.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> Notice how, as wandering groups settled, civilization
advanced and houses of wood and stone were erected.</p>

<p>Follow with a study of the permanent and beautiful homes of the
Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and show plans of the simple and
harmonious interiors. Then contrast these with the dwellings of the
Norsemen, the Goths, and other ruder nations, and see how, after they
had conquered Rome, they carried back some ideas of comfort and beauty.
A good encyclopedia will furnish references on these subjects.</p>

<p>Study the architecture of the Middle Ages, the great castles of Italy,
Spain, Germany, France, and England, with pictures from histories and
encyclopedias. Mention carvings and ornaments in stone and wood, used in
these castles. Unless this topic is to be expanded into a study of
architecture, it is better at this point to take up English houses
alone. Note the time when half-timbering prevailed, shown still in many
houses in Warwickshire and elsewhere. Take up the Tudor period, when red
brick was largely the material used and leaded casement windows are
seen. Carved furniture, panelled halls, and elaborate furniture were
also common. The Georgian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> and Victorian periods follow, and have a
certain interest; and then we come to our own country.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;THE AMERICAN HOUSE</h4>

<p>Houses built in Colonial and Revolutionary times were suggested by
English styles, and many were copies of existing houses. They were
largely built of wood, and the lines were simple and artistic. The Old
Manse at Concord, the Longfellow house at Cambridge, and well-known
Southern mansions are suggestive of the general style. The Dutch houses
of the day were often of stone, and were low, with deep roofs and
porches and huge fireplaces.</p>

<p>Soon after 1800 the period of experimental architecture began, and has
continued till of late, when we are slowly turning backward toward the
reproduction of old styles again. Nondescript houses, constructed to
please the passing fancy, have been the rule; mixed styles, inartistic
lines, and scrollwork have disfigured them.</p>

<p>Show from magazines the new ideas; reproductions of old English homes,
French chateaux, Tudor mansions; the combinations of brick, stone, and
wood; the use of cement, stucco, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> stone. We have adopted foreign
ideas, and are making them individual and valuable.</p>

<p>Have each member of the club bring in pictures and plans of modern
houses of all kinds, those of the city, the village, the farm, from the
cheapest to the most costly, and point out the new ideas and the old. A
good idea is to have a contest of plan-drawing on easy lines, to give
some practical knowledge of desirable points.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;BUILDING A HOME</h4>

<p>How shall one decide on a site for a new house? Embody these ideas in a
paper: See that the character of the neighborhood is desirable; that the
property in the vicinity is appreciating rather than depreciating. Note
the relation of the trolleys or the railroad. Are they accessible, yet
not too near for comfort? Is the condition of the street on which the
house will face attractive, well kept, and shaded?</p>

<p>Is the lot in good condition?&mdash;not too full of stones, not so low that
it will require filling, nor so high that it will need grading? Is it
drained? Are city water and gas at hand? Is there shade? Is the outlook
good? If in a country district, how near are the schools, the church,
the markets?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> What about the condition of the roads in winter?</p>

<p>Study of materials: Will stone, brick, wood, or cement be the best to
use for this particular house, and will one alone or two materials
combined be preferable? The use of local stone is often the best choice
of all, and gives a beautiful and durable house. Cement must be
fortified, or else have air-spaces. Cement or stucco combined with
timbers is always artistic.</p>

<p>As to the plan of the house, a careful study is necessary. See the plans
given in magazines and books, and make notes of what suits the family
needs best. Discuss the question, Is an architect really necessary, or
can a builder carry out a printed plan? Take up the placing of a house,
and observe that if it does not stand four-square, but rather with the
corners northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest, sunshine will
come into every room at some hour of the day. Have a paper or talk on
the sanitation of the country and village house especially, and of the
necessity of overseering the plumbing intelligently. The heating and the
conveniences of the house should be considered. Speak especially of the
point that each house should not only be attractive and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> convenient, but
suited to the needs of the individual family; and here, not the
architect, but the housekeeper and mother should assert herself.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;THE REMODELLED HOUSE</h4>

<p>What can be done to make over a city house that is unattractive? A paper
can easily be written on this up-to-date theme, showing how a narrow
brown-stone house with high front steps, a basement dining-room, and
small rooms can be made over. The outside can be covered with brick or
stucco, and perhaps blinds added. The steps can be removed, and an
English entrance constructed directly from the street. The stairs can be
turned around, making the hall much larger; the dining-room can be put
up-stairs, with a dumb-waiter. The small rooms, perhaps dark, can be
thrown together into one large living-room, and the windows enlarged.
Wood floors can be laid, dark wall-papers replaced with light, and the
whole will have a modern effect. Architects are specializing on this
point.</p>

<p>What can be done to make over a village house? All the ugly scrollwork
can be removed from the porch and windows, and any little pinnacles, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
perhaps a cupola from the roof. A wide, simple porch can replace the
narrow one; the house can then be shingled all over, and stained, or
painted in a quiet color. The small rooms may be thrown together, making
large ones, and small doorways can be made wider. The floors may be laid
in hard wood or Southern pine, or maybe painted or stained, and rugs may
take the place of carpets. The hangings may be dyed, if they are too
ornate; the old wall-paper may be replaced by something plain and quiet;
the pictures may be rehung. A bathroom may be put in, if there is none.
The kitchen may be made more convenient. The yard may be made attractive
with trees and shrubs. Unsightly out-buildings may be removed; the fence
may be improved. The porch may have vines and window-boxes, and be
furnished for a living-room, with awnings, chairs, and a table.</p>

<p>What can be done to make over a farmhouse? First of all, the barns and
out-buildings must be removed, or hidden behind screens of trees or
evergreens, or at least painted or stained. The yard must be put in
order, and shrubs and flowers set out. The house front door must be
opened, and a porch, or attractive entrance built, with vines. Within,
the front room should be arranged for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> daily use, with the doorway
widened, probably, and the windows opened and screened. The floor can be
stained, and a pretty rag rug laid down; ugly furniture can be replaced
with some of the simple, old-fashioned sort that is in keeping with the
character of the house. A fireplace may possibly be opened, and the
pictures rehung on freshly papered walls. The kitchen and dining-room
may have more modern conveniences, and water may be piped in from the
windmill or spring. The bedrooms may be made more airy, and perhaps a
bathroom added.</p>

<p>Show pictures of made-over houses of these and other kinds, and
emphasize the fact that much may be done with little outlay of money.
Speak of the new ideas in house-furnishing and the return to what is
suitable rather than what is merely costly or modern. Make the papers
practical, and have club-members tell what they have seen accomplished.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;THE SUMMER COTTAGE</h4>

<p>This is one of the most fascinating subjects of the year. Begin by
noting the kinds of houses needed for the mountains, the seashore, the
inland plain or valley, and the camp, and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> delightful variety. The
bungalow is the modern suggestion for any simple summer home, and it is
capable of infinite change to suit its surroundings.</p>

<p>The forest camp is usually planned to have several plain bungalows
rather than one, and they form a group, one for sleeping, one for
dining, one for cooking. Note the need of fireplaces, of screened
windows and doors, and provision for storing food. Show how bunks can
take the place of beds, and the charm of an out-of-door dining-room.</p>

<p>Seashore cottages should be built so as to avoid dampness; for this
reason stone or cement is not a good choice, but wood, with thin walls
which dry quickly. Fireplaces are essential, and deep porches on the
sheltered side of the house. There may be two stories to a bungalow of
this kind, rather than one, and the inside may be ceiled with wood, and
stained rather than plastered.</p>

<p>Inland cottages may be made of cobble or any native stone, or of wood,
or cement, or a combination. There should be large, deep porches, to be
used for living-rooms, and, if possible, out-of-door sleeping-porches.
The house should be so placed as to command the best view, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of the sunsets. There should be beautiful gardens all about the house.</p>

<p>Show pictures of all these styles of cottage, and of the famous
California bungalows, which are in every possible style and at all
prices.</p>

<p>Close this subject with a brief talk or paper on Furnishing the Summer
Home, mentioning that it should be done appropriately, not with
left-over city furniture, but with the plainer kinds which suit the
house. Speak of simple and attractive curtains and hangings, of the use
of chintzes and cretonnes, of white-painted beds and chairs, of porch
furniture. Notice also the labor-saving contrivances for summer
kitchens. Have members tell of what they have seen and done in summer;
close with a talk on the names of summer houses.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;THE APARTMENT</h4>

<p>The remarkable multiplication of apartments in the last few years is
noteworthy. Have their advantages and disadvantages presented, and
question: What are the essentials of a good, livable apartment?</p>

<p>Suggest that the street should be accessible and as quiet as possible;
the rooms not too small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> nor too crowded; that there should be light and
air in the sleeping-rooms; that a few good closets, a sanitary bathroom,
a convenient kitchen, are all necessary, and a private hall is
desirable.</p>

<p>Discuss the question: How does the furnishing of an apartment differ
from that of a house? Present the suggestion that as the rooms are apt
to be small there must not be too much furniture, and that what there is
should be plain, and simply upholstered. The wall-paper should be rather
light in color, and plain or self-figured; to have it all of one kind
makes the apartment look larger than if several kinds were used. There
should be few hangings, and light curtains. Note also these questions:
How can spaces be saved in sleeping and other rooms? What about heating
and ventilation? Is living in an apartment hygienic? Does it tend to
foster or discourage neighborliness? Does one form the habit of moving,
and is the sense of continuity of a permanent family home destroyed?
Have a discussion arranged in advance on these and similar points.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;FURNISHING THE HOME</h4>

<p>This very practical subject may be expanded into several meetings, since
it is distinctly educational.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Floors</i>&mdash;Carpets versus bare floors and rugs. What is the cost of hard
wood, of Southern pine, of painted or stained floors? In the long run,
are such floors and the necessary rugs more or less expensive than
carpets? What sort of rugs are desirable beyond the Oriental? What are
artistic, durable, harmonious in color and pattern? What can be done
with old carpets?</p>

<p><i>Walls</i>&mdash;The necessity of proper proportion should be emphasized; they
should be neither too high nor too low for the size of the room. If they
are wrong, what can be done? Show how papering can help the difficulty;
too low ceilings call for a narrow striped paper without a frieze; a too
high ceiling needs the calcimined ceiling carried down to a foot or more
on the wall, with a narrow molding where it meets the paper.</p>

<p>Study the subject of wall-paper, and show illustrations. The dark paper
absorbs the light. The gilt-medallioned paper is inartistic; hard,
bright colors are tiring to live with. Chintz papers are suitable for
bedrooms. Notice the value of self-toned papers, and of shades of tans
and pale browns.</p>

<p><i>Hangings</i>&mdash;Have a paper or talk here. Describe the ugliness of highly
colored, fringed, two-toned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> draped porti&egrave;res, and of imitation lace
curtains, such as Nottingham, and contrast with the beauty of simple,
plain hangings and curtains of net or muslin of good styles. Show
pictures from catalogues of good and bad hangings. Do not overlook the
fact that if windows are too large or too small, too high or too low,
their outline can be altered by their treatment. Present the
possibilities of stenciling.</p>

<p><i>Furniture</i>&mdash;This topic gives opportunity for a whole meeting. Get
catalogues from dealers, and illustrate papers on different styles of
furniture, English of several periods, French, German, Colonial, and the
modern varieties of no period at all. Read from Furniture of Olden
Times, by Alice C. Morse. Show how the plain lines of old mahogany are
forever beautiful. Contrast such furniture with the showy, ornate,
over-elaborate things we too often see to-day.</p>

<p>Make a point of the necessity of having few and simple chairs and tables
in small rooms; of the advantage of low bookcases over high ones; the
beauty of shaded lights over glaring white ones; of side lights and
lamps as better than a central chandelier or hanging lamp.</p>

<p>Pictures should be of good subjects; copies of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> great masters, and of
beautiful scenery or cathedrals, can be had in photographs; they should
be plainly framed, hung flat on the wall, and opposite the eye.
Bric-&agrave;-brac should be quiet in color and line, rather than complex and
pretentious; speak of the value of pottery, and, if possible, study a
little of what is being done in arts and crafts in all lines.</p>

<p>A practical discussion may follow on, What shall we do with our ugly
belongings? Let someone show how carpets can be dyed or made into rugs,
furniture simplified by removing the cheap ornamentation and staining
the whole, bookcases cut down, hangings made over.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;SPECIAL ROOMS</h4>

<p>Have illustrated papers or talks on these topics:</p>

<p><i>The Living-Room</i>&mdash;How can it best be made beautiful and comfortable?
What colors are best? what furniture? what pictures and ornaments? Where
shall the writing-desk, the large table, the piano, stand? What of the
floor, the curtains, the cushions? What is essential, and what can we do
without?</p>

<p><i>The Dining-Room</i>&mdash;Which side of the house is best to choose? What
colors are suitable for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> walls? What wood for the furniture? What
about a sideboard, glass-closet, pantry? How can we make over what we
have?</p>

<p><i>The Bedrooms</i>&mdash;Shall we use wood or metal beds? What of the floor? Are
wall-papers desirable? What of the use of chintz and white paint? What
curtains and hangings are best? What furniture can be home-made for the
bedroom?</p>

<p><i>The Boy's Room</i>&mdash;How can it be at once sensible and attractive? What
sort of furniture will he like best, and what colors? Shall there be a
place for "collections"?</p>

<p><i>The Girl's Room</i>&mdash;How shall this be at once dainty and practical? What
colors are suitable? If the room is small, how can the space be best
utilized? Does a pretty bedroom tend to make a girl orderly?</p>

<p>From this point have brief papers on other rooms: the mother's room; the
guest-room; the nursery; the playroom; the grandmother's room; the
out-of-door sleeping-room; the hospital room; the sewing-room; the
linen-closet; the attic; the cellar.</p>

<p>Close with a practical paper on that important room in the home, the
kitchen. Show that it is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> workroom, to be furnished and used as such.
Speak of the floor, the walls, and their finishing; the tables and
chairs; the pantries; the sink; the range; suggest labor-saving utensils
and contrivances, and use illustrations; notice that the kitchen must be
attractive as well as practical. Have members give ideas on all the
topics.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;THE CARE OF THE HOUSE</h4>

<p>Prepare in advance a discussion on these subjects: How much care shall
we put on our houses? Shall women give up all their time to keeping them
clean and orderly? What can they do to save steps? How much can the
children help? Shall boys be taught housework? What can be eliminated
from the daily routine?</p>

<p>If desired, there might be a practical talk on the necessity of keeping
paint in good condition, to protect the wood underneath; of the care of
glass, silver, marble, brass, hard wood; of how to prevent moths and
mice, and of how often carpets must come up. It is better, however, to
take up the larger aspects of the question, using such suggestions for
talks or papers as these: Has housekeeping lost some of its difficulties
to-day?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> What about modern appliances to avoid sweeping, and the like?
Has house-cleaning lost its terrors? Can the average woman consider
housekeeping as a profession? and if so, how and where can she best be
trained? Compare the modern housekeeper with the one of half a century
ago. Show how the trained housekeeper is a practical domestic economist.
Discuss, Business-like Housekeeping; How shall we best train our
daughters in it? If there is time, take up the servant question. Are our
ideas changing on this subject? Present the new plans for specialists,
with set hours, and the like.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;GARDENS</h4>

<p>This is one of the subjects which can be indefinitely expanded; indeed,
a whole year's study might easily be put on it.</p>

<p>Begin with a study of historic gardens from the earliest times, and read
Bacon's well-known essay. Then turn to the gardens of to-day, and begin
with the description of what can be done in an apartment when one can
have only window-boxes; take up the tiny plots behind city houses, and
show what can be done there, with vines over the fences, climbing roses
over a little arbor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> narrow beds by the edge of the grass; show
pictures of what has been done, if possible.</p>

<p>The lawn and small yard of a suburban house can next be studied, and
here a little ingenuity can be shown to accomplish a great deal. Speak
of the use of bulbs; of little cold-frames; of raising grapes under
glass in a small way, and of annuals, shrubs, vines, and roses.</p>

<p>The large gardens of our modern country houses deserve especial mention.
Have as many pictures as possible of these. Notice the formal gardens,
the Italian gardens, the sunken gardens, the rose gardens, the massed
shrubs, the walls of brick and stone, covered with vines. The adjuncts
of the gardens are often most beautiful also, the pergolas, the marble
and terra-cotta vases and seats, the sun-dials, the fountains, the
lily-ponds, and the vistas cut through the trees.</p>

<p>Old-fashioned and herb gardens, kitchen and market gardens, growing
violets and roses to sell, and the raising of unusual seeds and plants
are all topics of interest both theoretical and practical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>There are magazines which may easily be consulted for subjects for
discussion on landscape-gardening, the grouping of shrubs and trees, and
similar themes. There may be a valuable paper on Insects Which Destroy
Our Trees, and How to Deal with Them; the Agricultural Department at
Washington will gladly send pamphlets which will be of great use. There
might also be a talk on The Lumberman and the Government, and another on

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">English Novelists of To-day</span></h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>There is at the present day a more than usually interesting group of
writers in England. Their personality is delightful, and their point of
view is eminently modern, full of the spirit of the times. The material
for study must be gleaned largely from magazine articles, and by looking
over the files of such publications as the <i>Review of Reviews</i>, the
<i>Literary Digest</i>, the <i>Outlook</i>, and the <i>Bookman</i>, there will be found
sketches of the lives and work of all those given here. In addition the
New International Encyclop&aelig;dia has biographical sketches, and Poole's
Index and other reference books at a public library will direct to more
material.</p>

<p>All programs on these authors should be arranged in four parts: first,
the life of the author, as full as may be, with sketches of his
experiences, his home circle, his friends, his methods of work; second,
a criticism of his writing, his style, his mannerisms, the general trend
of his ideas, and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> mention of his place among writers; third,
readings from several of his books; and fourth, a discussion of his
characters by the club members.</p>

<p>In place of one of these topics, some clubs may prefer a paper showing
the change in the author's methods and style, based on a comparison of
his earlier and later writings.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;THOMAS HARDY</h4>

<p>Thomas Hardy was born in Dorsetshire in 1840, and educated to be an
architect. It was as a rebuilder of old churches that he became an
antiquarian and then a student of rural types, since his work took him
to country districts. His own county lives in his books under the name
of Wessex, and the people he draws are taken from life. He has a
sympathetic touch in dealing with their problems and peculiarities which
comes from close contact and genuine affection.</p>

<p>His first novel, Under the Greenwood Tree, was followed by a second
which won him popularity, Far from the Madding Crowd. This appeared
anonymously as a serial, and at the time was attributed to George Eliot,
because she was thought to be the only living author capable of writing
it. The Return of the Native is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> his most characteristic book,
although in Jude the Obscure he shows a merciless character analysis.
But in Tess of the D'Urbervilles he reaches the height of his power. It
is a story of tragedy, expressing the doctrine that man must reap what
he has sown. Read several chapters from Tess and discuss the story.</p>

<p>Hardy's short stories also are well known and a collection called Wessex
Tales will be found excellent for selections for club reading. The Three
Strangers is generally considered his best story. Notice the
descriptions of scenery, the characteristics of the country people and
their personalities. Does Hardy show a lack of humor? Is he a fatalist?</p>

<h4>II&mdash;MAURICE HEWLETT</h4>

<p>Maurice Hewlett was born in London in 1866, educated there, and admitted
to the bar. It was in the midst of city life that he wrote his first
novel, The Forest Lovers, which he has never excelled in beauty and
charm. It is an exquisite, simple picture of life in the Middle Ages,
with a lovely romance running through it. Critics tell us that of all
his contemporaries he has best interpreted medieval thought and
sentiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Later he wrote other novels of the same period, notably Richard
Yea-and-Nay, sometimes called an epic story, full of passion, war and
poetry. It was with this book that fame came to Hewlett.</p>

<p>In The Queen's Quair we have a study of Mary, Queen of Scots, her court
and the tragedy of her life. The Stooping Lady is laid in the Eighteenth
Century, but the author shows the same peculiarity, that of making any
time vividly real and preserving the atmosphere. This novel is full of
imagination, yet terse and clear. Hewlett has also written some short
stories of a delightful sort&mdash;Little Novels of Italy and The Madonna of
the Peach Tree, quite unlike his longer books.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that into all his writings the one idea is
woven so skilfully as to be almost imperceptible&mdash;of the progress of the
soul, either upward or downward. This key unlocks many of the puzzling
passages, especially in Richard Yea-and-Nay. Clubs can follow out this
suggestion in reading his books.</p>

<p>Read from the novels mentioned; note the strength of Jehan and the
subtlety of Mary. Read also from his three delightful out-of-door
stories of to-day, Half-Way House, Open Country,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> and Rest Harrow.
Compare the descriptions of scenery in England, Scotland, France and
Italy.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;MRS. HUMPHRY WARD</h4>

<p>Mrs. Humphry Ward, born of English parents in Tasmania in 1851, lived in
Oxford and was educated in the Lake Country. The granddaughter of Thomas
Arnold of Rugby, and the niece of Matthew Arnold, she inherited a strong
moral sense which was increased by the atmosphere of her home, and grew
up feeling that life was full of ethical problems. She married an Oxford
tutor, moved to London, wrote reviews, translated Amiel's Journal into
English, and then in 1888 wrote her first novel, Robert Elsmere, a
brilliant presentation of the religious difficulties of a young
clergyman, leading to his abandonment of orthodoxy. It attracted so much
attention that Gladstone thought it worth his while to review it and
combat its views.</p>

<p>She wrote later The History of David Grieve, contrasting the spiritual
development of a brother and a sister. This is called her most vital
book. Marcella, her most powerful book, deals with the problem of
socialism in England. Then came Sir George Tressady, Eleanor, Lady
Rose's Daughter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> Fenwick's Career, and others. Her later books, if more
finished, lack the strength of her earlier.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward has often been compared with George Eliot; clubs will find it
interesting to note resemblances and differences and compare heroines
and plots. Which of the two best concealed the moral purpose both used
as the theme of their books? Read from several of Mrs. Ward's earlier
volumes and also some selections from George Eliot's Adam Bede and
Romola. Discuss the sense of humor shown by the two authors.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;HALL CAINE</h4>

<p>Hall Caine, though of Manx descent, was born in Cheshire in 1853, but he
has always seemed less of an Englishman than a Manxman. His stories all
have the atmosphere of the little Isle of Man, and his plots are laid
there. Yet he lived in London as architect, journalist, novelist, and
dramatist. There is much that is interesting about his life, especially
the year that he spent with Rossetti.</p>

<p>His best books are The Shadow of a Crime, The Deemster, The Bondman, The
Scapegoat, and The Christian. In all of them there is a definite
somberness, a noticeable element of tragedy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> only slightly relieved by
the lighter aspects of life. His novels deal with profound issues.</p>

<p>Clubs should notice the relations' of fathers and sons in the books
mentioned. Discuss the problems presented; read the descriptions of Manx
life among the people; compare the heroes. Read several of the dramatic
chapters from The Scapegoat and The Deemster. Does the play The
Christian show more strength than the novel of the same name?</p>

<h4>V&mdash;STANLEY J. WEYMAN</h4>

<p>In striking contrast with this last novelist is Stanley J. Weyman, the
writer of fascinating historical novels which rank among the very first
of their kind. Born in Shropshire in 1855 and educated at Oxford, he
became first a lawyer and then a novelist. His Gentleman of France
brought him immediately into prominence.</p>

<p>The scenes of most of his books are laid in France, either in the period
of the Great Cardinal, or later in that of the Revolution. They are
crowded with adventure, the plots are of absorbing interest and his
characters are full of life and individuality. The times of which he
writes are described with accurate fidelity, and his pictures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> of the
court, of campaigning, of travel, of village life, are romantic yet
historically correct. Under the Red Robe, The Red Cockade, The Castle
Inn, and The Abbess of Vlaye are all fascinating. Read from any one of
these and then from a good history giving an idea of the same period,
and note the precise study Weyman gave to his settings.</p>

<p>A paper might be prepared on Sir Walter Scott, Dumas, Hewlett and Weyman
as historical novelists. The differences might be brought out by
comparing the character of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion in The Talisman and
Richard Yea-and-Nay, and that of Richelieu in The Three Musketeers and
Under the Red Robe.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;JAMES M. BARRIE</h4>

<p>James M. Barrie is a Scotchman, born in 1860 and educated at Edinburgh
University. He knows thoroughly his own people. He does not write with
any defined moral purpose, nor does he have any great events to record;
but he has in an unusual degree the power to charm. His sympathetic
insight, delightfully sly humor, play of fancy and light touch of pathos
are all unique.</p>

<p>A Window in Thrums, describing the lives of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> the weavers, so apart from
the world yet so full of interest, Auld Licht Idylls, with its amusing
difficulties of the old churches, and Margaret Ogilvy, the exquisite
portrait of the author's mother, are unsurpassed in delicate beauty. In
Sentimental Tommy, Tommy and Grizel, and The Little Minister there is
more of plot and more also of a certain gaiety. The Little White Bird
shows the fancy which comes out more strongly in the incomparable Peter
Pan.</p>

<p>Read from as many of Barrie's books as possible, and then discuss his
work as a playwright. Do his books lend themselves to the stage? Let
those who have seen The Little Minister, The Admirable Crichton, Peter
Pan and Little Mary describe them.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;HORATIO GILBERT PARKER</h4>

<p>Horatio Gilbert Parker, now Sir Gilbert, is both English and Canadian.
His career has been marked by a great variety of experience, as his
books show. Born in Ontario in 1802, he became a teacher, then a curate,
then an instructor in a deaf and dumb asylum, went to Australia for his
health and there took up journalism and play-writing, returned to Canada
and became a novelist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> Later he decided to live in England and went
into Parliament. Many of his earlier novels are of Canadian life. When
Valmond Came to Pontiac, The Seats of the Mighty, and The Right of Way
are among the best of his early books. Later he wrote The Weavers, a
strange mingling of East and West in the story of a Quaker in modern
Egypt. His best recent novel is The Judgment House, having for its theme
English society in the time of the Boer War. His versatility in turning
from one scene to another, and from one type of character to another, is
remarkable. Canada, Egypt, London, and Africa are all familiar ground to
him, and trappers, Indians, Frenchmen of the seventeenth century, and
men and women of to-day in cities are all equally well drawn. His early
style was perhaps too diffuse, but his later stories are briefer and
more direct. Read from The Seats of the Mighty and The Judgment House.
Note his different types in his books and discuss them. Read also from
the scenes in the different countries and see the local color.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;HERBERT G. WELLS</h4>

<p>Herbert G. Wells was born in Kent in 1866. He had a scientific training,
and his first book was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> a text book on biology. Later he became one of
the staff of <i>The Saturday Review</i> and then combined science and
literature in a series of romantic novels: His Time Machine, The Wheels
of Chance and The War of the Worlds are all stories in which his
scientific education was utilized. In 1906 he came to America to study
social conditions and since then has written two books in quite another
vein&mdash;Tono Bungay, a story of finance, and Marriage, a study of modern
conditions of love and society.</p>

<p>His earlier work is marked by wild imagination; his later by swift
analysis and warm sympathy. Compare the realistic description of village
life in Part I. of Tono Bungay with that of the Five Towns in Arnold
Bennett's Old Wives' Tale, mentioned later. Note Wells's socialistic
leanings.</p>

<p>Read from The War of the Worlds and Marriage. Contrast the two styles;
discuss the character of Marjorie in the latter; is she a possible
woman?</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;WILLIAM J. LOCKE</h4>

<p>William J. Locke, born of English parents in Barbadoes in 1803, was
educated at Cambridge, where he took the highest honors in mathematics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
He became a teacher, and it was only after years of hated drudgery that
he obtained a secretary's position and leisure to write. For long his
novels were little known, though At the Gate of Samaria, The Derelicts,
Idols, and The White Dove were all full of interest and promise. Then
with The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne, called his greatest book, and The
Beloved Vagabond, his most popular, he suddenly became famous. Septimus,
Simon the Jester and The Glory of Clementina have followed one another
rapidly, and Septimus has been dramatized.</p>

<p>Locke's style is so easy as to conceal its art. His plots are lightly
constructed and many of his novels have unexpected endings. His men are
much alike, but so delightful that no one would have them altered. Each
has a certain chivalry, an ability to endure hardships, a lack of
practical judgment, but a simple goodness that is irresistible. Their
humor is charming, and their gentle philosophy convincing. Locke holds
the theory that life should be accepted cheerfully; this is his dominant
theme.</p>

<p>Clubs should read the amusing diatribe against teaching, and especially
against teaching mathematics, in Marcus. Read also the first and last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
chapters of the Vagabond and Clementina. Compare his women and his men.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;ARNOLD BENNETT</h4>

<p>Arnold Bennett, in many ways the most talked-of English author living,
was born in Staffordshire in 1867 in a district known as "The
Potteries," or "The Five Towns." Here are furnaces, collieries,
manufactories and a people whose interests are made narrow and
provincial by the restricted boundaries of their lives.</p>

<p>Bennett went to London, became a journalist, an essayist, an editor, a
novelist, and a playwright. He lived for a time in Paris and traveled
extensively, and he has made use of his varied experiences in his
writings.</p>

<p>He has some remarkable books, long, careful, full of psychological
problems. His Old Wives' Tale, Anna of the Five Towns and Clay-hanger
all deal with the place and the people with which he was first familiar,
and are graphic pictures of types. In Hilda Lessways he presents a study
rather unlike those in his first books, and in Denry the Audacious and
Buried Alive he has quite another manner and keener humor.</p>

<p>He is singularly direct and painstaking in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> work, a master of
realism. For sheer observation, says one critic, he is unequaled. Of
late he has visited America and made a close and remarkably sympathetic
study of our country, our cities, our manners.</p>

<p>Take up Bennett also as a playwright, and note the good work he has done
in this field; contrast his plays with his earlier books. Read from
Hilda Lessways and from the graphic description of the siege of Paris in
the Old Wives' Tale, and also a descriptive chapter from the Five Towns.
Compare his realistic work with that of Henry James, and note the
differences. Quote from his little essay, How to Live on Twenty-four
Hours a Day.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The material for this meeting is very great, especially on the
biographical side. Interesting brief papers might be prepared on any of
the names mentioned. Sainte-Beuve, considered by many to be the greatest

<p>As Moli&egrave;re is unquestionably the great dramatist of the period, devote
the day largely to him. Read from Chatfield-Taylor's Pathway to Fame,
which gives the dramatist's life as a strolling player. Describe one of
the f&ecirc;tes for which he wrote his little farces and ballets. Have a brief
talk on the advance in stage-setting at this time, due to the unlimited
sums Louis spent on his f&ecirc;tes, and the employment of the greatest
artists for the scenery. Compare this with the setting of the stage in
Shakespeare's theater.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

of French Art. Bourgeois: France under Louis XIV. W.&nbsp;H. Ward:
Architecture of the Renaissance in France. Esther Singleton: French and
English Furniture.</p>

<p>Louis was a wonderful art patron, and spent enormous sums upon artistic
objects. He brought from Antwerp a group of three great engravers. He
established the Beauvais and Gobelins manufactories of tapestry.
Porcelain was made at Saint Cloud. Furniture was designed by Ballin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> and
Boule. Len&ocirc;tre led the world in the art of landscape-gardening.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE KING AND THE CHURCH</h4>

<p>1. <i>The King's Personal Religion</i>&mdash;Ecclesiastical and political rather
than ethical. His devotions and his morals. Effect of Madame de
Maintenon's influence in later years.</p>

<p>2. <i>Two Great Prelates and Their Feud</i>&mdash;Bossuet; his ability, temper,

success of Pere LeTellier. Reading from Pascal's Provincial Letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;The Cambridge Modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> History: vol. v., chap. iv.
Guizot: History of France: vol. iv., chap. xlvii. Jervis: History of the
Church in France. Sainte-Beuve: Causeries du Lundi (many are
translated).</p>

<p>As Louis seldom went to Paris, the chapel in the palace at Versailles
became the scene of the most important ecclesiastical functions, and
hence is of special interest. A description of its interior should be
given, and photographs of it should be shown. A supplementary paper
should take up Madame de Maintenon and her relation to the king and the
Church. Lady Blennerhasset's book will be found of value in this
connection.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;THE STORY OF PORT-ROYAL</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Convent</i>&mdash;Its location, origin, and early history. Fashionable
patronage and relaxation of the rules. Ang&eacute;lique Arnauld. The Paris

Story of Port-Royal. Felix Cadet: Port-Royal Education. Sainte-Beuve:
Port-Royal. (In French, not translated.)</p>

<p>Prepare a supplementary paper on the Puritan Spirit in Human Nature.
This constantly reappears in history (see the Stoics), and is
represented in France in this period by this Jansenist movement. An
interesting paper might be written on Jacqueline Pascal, the sister of
the great philosopher, and the celebrated episode of her healing, which
had far-reaching consequences.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;FAMOUS MEMOIRS OF THE TIME</h4>

<p>1. <i>Cardinal de Retz</i>&mdash;Story of his adventurous life: description of his
appearance and personal characteristics. Relation to the Fronde.

<p>Notice the striking change at this time from former dull and tedious
historical writing to the brilliant and fascinating personal sketches
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> people and events. Read descriptions of the King and the court from
Saint-Simon and Saint-Amand. The engravers whom Louis brought from the
Low Countries made portraits of many of the society people of the time;
show reproductions, and describe the dress of the period.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Forestry</span></h3>

<p>The study of this subject is a novel one for women's clubs, but it is of
great interest. Women who desire an intelligent view of their own
country should certainly take it up and understand what is being done
to-day and what is planned for the future. Books to be read are: A First
Book of Forestry, by F. Roth; A Primer of Forestry, by Gifford Pinchot;
and The Forest and Practical Forestry, the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;INTRODUCTORY</h4>

<p>All uncivilized nations ruthlessly cut off their forests for fuel and
timber, both ignorant and indifferent to the result of the destruction.
Where there are no trees, the water-supply dies away, the soil then
becomes infertile, and the population is threatened with famine. China
is practically denuded of trees, after unknown centuries of waste. India
has numberless hillsides and plains once wooded, now bare and parched;
and so of many other Oriental countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<h4>II&mdash;THE BEGINNINGS OF FORESTRY</h4>

<p>Early in the sixteenth century there was a certain realization of the
danger of neglect of trees; Sully, the great minister of France,
suggested that some restrictions should be laid on cutting, and some
study of forestry made by the government. Germany also followed the same
course, and England, which began to feel the shortage of timber
severely, practised more careful cutting and set out certain
plantations. The great landowners everywhere cared for their timber in
their private parks, and cut only when necessary. At the beginning of
the eighteenth century planting was begun in Scotland and later in
Ireland, and it is interesting to note that now the planted areas exceed
the natural growth in these two countries. Foreign trees were also
introduced at this time, and in many cases flourished even better than
the natural growths.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;PRESENT CONDITIONS ABROAD</h4>

<p>Practically now every civilized country practises forestry in a greater
or less degree. Germany has nine schools where it is taught, and there
are four and a half billion acres under government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> care. France is
equally careful, and every forest is guarded, though its schools are not
as many. England has a forest policy which calls for the planting of
nine million acres, ten thousand each year. Russia has such enormous
forests that as yet the care of her trees does not seem to her
critically important, yet she too is beginning to conserve her
resources. Italy has been almost stripped of her forests by neglect, but
she is at last waking to her peril and beginning to foster what is left.
In India an interesting work is being done by the English, who are
establishing schools for the natives to teach forestry; this in time
will make the country far more fertile than now. New Zealand, always
progressive, has a well-planned system; Argentine, Hawaii, and Terra del
Fuego practise the science.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;THE PAST IN AMERICA</h4>

<p>Forestry was begun at home by one man, Jared Eliot of Salisbury,
Connecticut, who in 1730 began to cut his trees systematically for
charcoal furnaces. But unfortunately no one followed in his footsteps
because our forests were so rich that it did not seem necessary;
thirty-six per cent. of all our area is in trees. This fact has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> made us
reckless; whole hillsides have been constantly stripped by farmers for
wood, or to make arable land. Great trees have been cut down when
smaller ones would have done quite as well. Worst of all, the lumbermen
of the Middle West and South have swept clean enormous areas of land,
cutting down large and small pines alike, and leaving nothing but
stumps.</p>

<p>Even more destructive have been the forest-fires which have sprung up
through carelessness or drouth, and suffered to burn unhindered till
they died out. As late as 1910 twenty-five million dollars' worth of
natural timber was destroyed, partly in the Far West and partly in the
East. Of late, too, certain insects have made havoc with large tracts,
and hills have been left bare and brown where they have been.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;CONSERVATION</h4>

<p>In 1882 the Forestry Association was formed to correct existing evils,
to care for standing timber, and to restock where that was necessary.
There are now over six thousand members of the association, and a paper
of great interest is published, called <i>American Forestry</i>, which gives
practical suggestions. This association has accomplished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> marvels in the
few years of its existence. In 1899 there were thirty-six
forest-reserves in the West. In addition, many States have their own
reserves.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;RENEWAL</h4>

<p>In addition to caring for existing trees, others now are planted. Some
States have bounties for this purpose; others maintain nurseries where
saplings are raised and set out; seeds are sown; foreign trees are
introduced; in our public schools our children are instructed in the
growth and care of trees, and many have Arbor Day, when trees are
planted and exercises held to impress the children with the importance
of the occasion.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;SCHOOLS OF FORESTRY</h4>

<p>There is a definite plan to have forestry taught in every State, and
short courses have been added to the curriculum of the State
universities. Yale and Cornell have forestry schools, and Harvard a
forestry course. At Biltmore, North Carolina, there is an excellent
school with exceptional forest advantages. Clubs can send for catalogues
of these schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE RETURNS</h4>

<p>Forestry does not aim to produce immediate commercial returns; indeed,
from that standpoint the returns are slow; yet in the end these are
greater than when the science is disregarded. Trees must be regarded as
a crop to be cut only in small sections rather than as a whole. But the
system once thoroughly established, the returns are steady and sure.
Timber is cut exactly at the right time instead of at haphazard, and so
is of the right size and age. Fuel is gathered from trees meant for that
purpose, and timber for building purposes from trees meant for that
alone.</p>

<p>In addition to the commercial results there are also others. Parks are
set aside for recreation and beauty, and game is preserved rather than
destroyed. Hillsides are renewed; winds are kept off; our watersheds are
protected, and rivers and streams kept full, and the land fertile.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;FAMOUS TREES</h4>

<p>Add to this study program two more meetings. Have one on Famous Trees
and Forests, naming among others: The Cedars of Lebanon, the historic
King's Oak which sheltered Charles I.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> the Charter Oak, and others;
note also the famous redwoods of California; the Burnham Beeches; the
historic Sherwood Forest; the New Forest and Dean Forest of England; the
Black Forest of Baden and the forests of the Vosges Mountains of France.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;TREES AND FORESTS IN LITERATURE</h4>

<p>The last program of the year may be on the general subject of trees and
forests in literature. Read or recite from such poems as: A Forest Hymn
and the Planting of the Apple Tree, by William Cullen Bryant; Christmas
in the Woods, by Harrison Weir; Forest Pictures, by Paul Hamilton Hayne;
the Summer Woods, by William Henry Burleigh; The Primeval Forest, from
Evangeline, by Longfellow; The Holly Tree, by Robert Southey, and The
Trees and the Master, by Sidney Lanier. Read from The Quest of John
Chapman, by Newell Dwight Hillis, and also from The Forest, by Stewart
Edward White.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>As this is the last program in which Shakespeare's plays are taken up in
detail, the important subject might be discussed of the relation of the
plays to the author's own life and mental development. (See Dowden's
book.) Special study should be made of the exquisite songs in which the
last three plays are particularly rich. Hark, Hark, the Lark! and Fear
No More, from Cymbeline, Jog On and When Daffodils Begin, from Winter's

<h4>VII&mdash;SONNETS AND OTHER POEMS</h4>

<p>1. <i>Venus and Adonis</i>&mdash;Early experiment in narrative verse. The story
founded on Ovid, with medieval alterations of the legend. Character of
the theme acceptable to the Renaissance spirit, but impossible to-day.
Correctness of the text.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>&mdash;Story of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. Legend
unaltered by the poet. Lucrece, the model of conjugal fidelity in the
Middle Ages. Who was the Earl of Southampton, to whom the poem was
dedicated? What did the other poets of Shakespeare's time think of these
early poems?</p>

<p>3. <i>Shorter Poems</i>&mdash;A Lover's Complaint, The Passionate Pilgrim, and The
Ph&oelig;nix and the Turtle. Shakespeare's part in the second and his
indignation at the use of his name for the whole. The "unsolved enigma"
of the last.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Sonnets</i>&mdash;The origin of the sonnet form in Italy. The plan of
the series. Comparison of the collection with Wordsworth's sonnet
sequences, Mrs. Browning's Sonnets, and Tennyson's In Memoriam. The
problem of W.&nbsp;H. Read the Sonnets, 18, 22, 33, 116.</p>

Sidney Lee: introductions to the several poems. Israel Gollanez:
Shakespeare's Sonnets. Edward Dowden: Shakespeare's Sonnets. Parke
Godwin: New Study of the Sonnets of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The most interesting problem about the sonnets is whether or not they
are a revelation of Shakespeare's own experience and views of life, or
are wholly imaginative. On this point read from Wordsworth, Scorn Not
the Sonnet, and Browning's House, in which the two poets take opposite
views. For a full and most interesting discussion see Dowden's essay.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE WOMEN OF SHAKESPEARE</h4>

<p>1. <i>Introductory</i>&mdash;Variety of characters and pronounced individuality.
Different types represented. Not peculiar to his age, but timeless.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Women of Intellect</i>&mdash;Portia: the woman of wisdom and learning.
Is she Shakespeare's highest female type? Beatrice: the fine lady, of
wit and high spirits. Readings&mdash;Portia: the casket scene and the court
scene from the Merchant of Venice. Beatrice: first and last scenes from
Much Ado.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Women of Sentiment</i>&mdash;Juliet: woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> of the South; romantic and
intense. Desdemona; woman of the North; modest, tender, self-restrained.
Readings&mdash;Juliet: Act iii., Scenes 2 and 5, of Romeo and Juliet.

Macbeth. Katharine: Act v., Scene 2 (beginning "Fair Katharine"), from
Henry V.</p>

<p>6. <i>Women of Various Types</i>&mdash;Illustrative readings from As You Like It

<p>The club members could add interest to this meeting by recalling the
famous actresses they may have seen, and comparing their presentations
of Shakespeare's women. For example, Mary Anderson as Juliet, Ada Rehan
as Katharine, Ellen Terry as Portia, Modjeska as Rosalind, and Julia
Marlowe as Ophelia.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;SHAKESPEREAN PROBLEMS</h4>

<p>1. <i>His Personality</i>&mdash;How much education had Shakespeare? Did he reveal
himself in his plays? What were his personal characteristics?</p>

<p>2. <i>Characteristics of His Work</i>&mdash;Did he plagiarize? If so, was he
justified? Was his meaning always clear to himself? See Richard Grant
White on this point. Is his broad humor defensible? Discuss Taine's
criticism on this point.</p>

<p>3. <i>Estimate of Shakespeare in His Own and Later Times</i>&mdash;What did his
contemporaries think of him? Why was he ignored in the later seventeenth
century? Quote from great writers on Shakespeare: Coleridge, Goethe,
Swinburne, etc.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Bacon-Shakespeare Controversy</i>&mdash;Origin: story of Delia Bacon's
life. Is there a cipher in Shakespeare? Quotation of learned opinion on
both sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

Elizabethan. Arthur Gilman: Shakespeare's Morals. Ignatius Donnelly: The
Great Cryptogram. Charlotte Carmichael Stopes: Bacon-Shakespeare
Question Answered.</p>

<p>Have a talk on Shakespeare the historian. Is he trustworthy? Does he
give an accurate account of events or only reproduce general color? Have
a discussion on the character of Hamlet. Was he really mad? Did
Shakespeare intend so to represent him, or to leave the matter in doubt?
For those interested in such things, the subject of the early editions
of Shakespeare, and their relation to one another, is one of great
fascination. A description of the immensely costly collection recently
presented to the Elizabethan Club at Yale might be given.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;FAMOUS PRESENTATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS</h4>

<p>1. <i>English</i>&mdash;Garrick, Charles Kean, Siddons, Charles Kemble, Lady
Faucit, Irving, Terry, Tree, Benson. Descriptions and anecdotes from
Boswell's Johnson, Charles Lamb's Essays, Fanny Burney's Diary, and
Ellen Terry's life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>American</i>&mdash;Forrest, the elder and younger Booth, Barrett, Ada Rehan,
Mansfield, Sothern, and Marlowe.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Theater at Stratford-on-Avon</i>&mdash;Description of it with views.
Story of some of the famous presentations given there. Differences
between these and those of Shakespeare's own time.</p>

<p>4. <i>Discussion of the Question of Stage Settings</i>&mdash;Was that of
Shakespeare's time better, with no scenery, and all the effect lying in
the meaning of the lines; or is the method of to-day preferable with its
elaborate, costly, and spectacular scenery and stage effects? Describe
the change in stage ideas due to the invention of the electric light.</p>

<p>5. <i>Description of Plays Seen</i>&mdash;Brief statements by the club members of
the Shakespearean representations they have witnessed, with an analysis
of their impressions of plays and of actors.</p>

from newspaper files the dramatic criticisms of the plays presented.
Describe some of the famous theaters of America in past and present
times. Close with a discussion of the personal attitude of the club
members toward Shakespeare's plays as compared with those written
to-day. Is there a Shakespearean affectation?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Employments of Women</span></h3>

<p>In arranging a year's program from this outline, have several meetings
on the older occupations of women before bringing the study down to
present times, when the work becomes more varied. The first five topics
may be made very interesting if there are readings from histories of the
Middle Ages on the work of women at that time. Where possible, clubs
should make trips to museums or libraries and examine work exhibited
there.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;POTTERY</h4>

<p>Making clay pots for household use is one of the first things women did.
They took ordinary earth, moulded it roughly, and baked it in their
domestic fires until it would hold water and food. Such pots are found
everywhere where there are ancient remains, among the lake dwellers in
Switzerland, among Egyptians and Greeks, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> in the ruins in Mexico.
Later, men took this work largely to themselves, and kept it until our
own day, when women have begun to make beautiful pottery, glazed and
decorated. Show pictures from catalogues of such potteries as the
Rookwood and others, and mention also the good work that is done
privately and fired in small kilns.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;SPINNING AND WEAVING</h4>

<p>Begin the study of this delightful topic back in the earliest times, and
show how step by step it advanced. Woolen and linen fabrics were made by
the ancients, and dyed with vegetable colors, for clothing and for
hangings. Notice the tapestries of later days, especially those first
woven in Flanders and Arras, which were so valuable they were used only
by royalty or in churches. Have a paper on tapestry made at home, in
castles, and even in royal residences, by the household of women. Speak
also of the work done in Colonial days by our grandmothers, of the linen
sheets and blankets spun and woven, and of the beautiful blue-and-white
coverlets of the period. Show some of the latter, if possible. Read from
the book called Tapestry and Embroidery, by Cole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<h4>III&mdash;EMBROIDERY</h4>

<p>Almost as soon as skins were made into garments the art of decoration
was discovered, and feathers and shells were sewed to them in patterns,
and stitches taken with colored fibers, grasses, and shreds of wool. The
primitive tribes of Indians, especially in South America, use exactly
the same methods to-day. Embroidery was always distinctly women's work,
men never sharing in it as they did in making pottery. In Egypt,
Assyria, and among the Jews it became much more elaborate and artistic.
Tyre and Sidon were noted for their beautiful work. Homer describes
embroidered garments among the Greeks; Roman women wore showy colored
borders on their skirts and scarfs.</p>

<p>In the early Middle Ages ecclesiastical embroidery, done largely in gold
and silver threads, was known in Europe, and much exquisite work of the
kind was done in the convents. Matilda, the wife of William the
Conqueror, and her women made the famous Bayeux tapestry, which was
really embroidery.</p>

<p>The embroidery of the Orient, especially that of China and India, is
famous, though this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> not done exclusively by women. Mention the
originality of the patterns used, the brilliance of the silk, and the
permanence of the colors. Note also the lovely white embroidery done by
the French and other nations.</p>

<h4>IV&mdash;LACE-MAKING</h4>

<p>This art grew out of that of embroidery, for the thin parts of the
latter were cut out, leaving the effect of heavy, colored lace. A book
was published in 1527, called The New and Subtile Book Concerning the
Art and Science of Embroidery, Fringes, and Tapestries, as Well as Other
Crafts Done with the Needle, and in this book there are patterns for
lace. The Venetians first mastered the making of white lace with the
needle, and produced heavy, effective designs. Under Louis XIV. delicate
lace was made in France, especially that called Valen&ccedil;on. Pillow-lace
made with bobbins was invented by a woman in Saxony about the middle of
the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Have papers on the laces peculiar to different countries, and show
examples or pictures of them. English thread in white and black; Spanish
silk, hand-run; Irish crochet; Valenciennes, and others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> See Palliser's
History of Lace for description and illustrations. If possible, visit a
museum which has a collection of laces; there is an excellent one in the
Metropolitan, of New York. Study also the conditions under which the
laces are made, the lives of lace-workers, and the prices received by
them for their work.</p>

<h4>V&mdash;BASKET-WEAVING</h4>

<p>Like the making of pottery, the weaving of baskets goes back to the very
earliest times. Women soon learned how to twist together osiers or twigs
and make them into receptacles for household use. As time went on,
baskets became more beautiful and artistic, and all nations, but
particularly those of the Orient, made them in delicate materials and
lovely designs. Often savage peoples will be found who excel in
basketry. Notice especially the baskets made by the North American
Indian women, and see the book on Basketry, by G.&nbsp;W. James, which is
full of illustrations.</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;MODERN HANDICRAFT FOR WOMEN</h4>

<p>Have club members make as many programs from the subjects following as
they desire, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> illustrate them as far as possible with examples of
the work. Take up also the schools where designing is taught, and tell
what is done there. Note the growth of all designing work for women;
bookbinding; jewelry-making; stenciling; making of furniture; bead-work;
knitting, crocheting, sewing, quilting, and patchwork; rug-making; work
in leather and wood; china-painting; work in plaster.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;WOMEN IN THE PROFESSIONS AND ARTS</h4>

<p>Clubs should have papers on each one of the following representative
women, showing what they accomplished. In addition there might be a
study of the women of to-day who are doing good work on similar lines.
In astronomy, Caroline Herschel; in music, Fanny Mendelssohn; in
philanthropy, Elizabeth Fry or Florence Nightingale; in painting, Rosa
Bonheur or Elizabeth Thompson Butler; in sculpture, Harriet Hosmer; in
education, Mary Lyon; in the lecture field, Mary A. Livermore; on the
stage, Charlotte Cushman or Rachel; as poet, Mrs. Browning; as novelist,
George Eliot.</p>

<p>Add to this list some names of women who are doctors, lawyers,
ministers, editors, teachers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> nurses. See Lives of Girls Who Became
Famous Women, by Sarah K. Bolton.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;WOMEN IN BUSINESS</h4>

<p>Have one or more practical papers showing what women have done and can
do in the field of every-day work. The Trained Mother might come first,
and then Woman as Housekeeper. After that take her as teacher,
governess, stenographer, saleswoman, dressmaker and milliner, caterer,
landscape-gardener, architect, dairy-woman, real-estate dealer,
house-decorator, and buyer. Follow with a paper or talk showing what can
be done in unusual ways to earn one's living; keeping a tea-room,
shopping, caring for children, mending, packing, preserving, and
embroidering.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;SUMMARY</h4>

<p>Close the year with a broad view of the whole subject. What about
woman's work in general? Is it well done and well paid? What of factory
work, domestic service, and work in shops? Under what conditions is such
work done? What of the question of equal pay? What of the "living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
wage"? What is being done for working girls? Do settlements, vacation
homes, and the like meet their needs? Read Olive Schreiner's Woman and
Labor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Important Movements of Our Times</span></h3>

<p>Sufficient material is given under each of the following ten heads for
clubs to divide into two or more meetings.</p>

<h4>I&mdash;THE PEACE MOVEMENT</h4>

<p>The first Peace Society was founded in New York, in 1815. A second was
organized six months later in Boston and the following year a third in
London. The first International Peace Congress was held in 1843, in
London. From that time till the present, many congresses have been held
all over the world, and Peace Societies exist everywhere, forty in
America alone.</p>

<p>The object of all societies is to so establish an orderly state of
affairs that war shall be impossible. The consular and diplomatic
services work along these lines, and advocate treaties between nations.
The gradual reduction of standing armies and navies is also one of the
aims of the movement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hague Tribunal was established in 1899, to adjust differences
between nations who cannot settle them for themselves. Between that year
and 1912 one hundred and sixty-seven such settlements were made.</p>

<p>The gift of $10,000,000 by Andrew Carnegie and the bestowal of the Nobel
Prize have put the Peace Movement on so secure a financial basis that
its future is assured.</p>

<p>Read the reports of the great Peace Conference in New York in 1907, and
select readings from its addresses. See also Chittenden's book, Peace or
War.</p>

<p>Clubs will find it worth while to preface this study with one meeting on
War. Speak of the cost of standing armies and navies, of loss of life in
great battles, of military schools, of compulsory military service.
Discuss: Is war ever necessary?</p>

<h4>II&mdash;WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE</h4>

<p>1. The movement in the past. Briefly sketch the history of woman in
early times, in the Middle Ages, and later, to the present. Notice that
the modern movement may be said to have begun when in 1647 Mary Brent,
the representative of Lord Baltimore, demanded a seat in the
representative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> body of Maryland. In the middle of the last century such
women as Margaret Fuller, Lydia Maria Child, Lucretia B. Mott, Susan B.
Anthony, Emma Willard, Mary Putman Jacobi and Elizabeth Cady Stanton
became the leaders of the Woman's Rights party, and the first convention
was held in New York state, in 1846. Give sketches of these and other
women; tell of the demands they made, and the result of the convention.
On what did the suffrage party base its claims?</p>

<p>2. The movement to-day. Have a paper or talk on the conditions in
Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, Finland, Scotland,
Ireland and Wales, and last, on England, called "The storm center."</p>

<p>What of our country? Which states have equal suffrage, and how does it
work? What especial questions are of vital interest to women, and how
will they be aided by the vote?</p>

<p>What of woman's physical and mental ability to handle political issues?
What of such work as that of soldier, sailor, worker on roads, in
sewers, on the police and fire boards?</p>

<p>What of her relation to her home if equal suffrage is granted?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Name some of the women in England and America who are especially leaders
in the movement, and tell of their position and work.</p>

<p>See books and magazine articles by Jane Addams, Ida Tarbell and Mrs. Ida
Husted Harper. See also: The Modern Woman's Rights Movement, by
Schirmacher.</p>

<h4>III&mdash;THE PROHIBITION MOVEMENT</h4>

<p>Prohibition is an attempt to abolish the manufacture and sale of
alcoholic liquors, except for purposes of industry, science, art and
medicine. It declares that the capital now in the liquor traffic would,
if invested in legitimate business, give employment to hundreds of
thousands of men. It would promote commerce, protect labor, preserve
health, conserve the interests of home and state. It would prevent
cruelty, pauperism, disease and crime.</p>

<p>The movement for prohibition was merely local until 1851, when the Neal
Dow law was passed, making Maine a prohibition state. The nation and
state also combined at this time to prevent the sale of liquor to the
Indians. At the close of the Civil War new conditions arose;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> German
beer was imported, and huge breweries and distilleries were built at
home. Numerous states then took up the matter of prohibition, and many
have had laws passed prohibiting manufacture and sale of all
intoxicants, most of them repealed or declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In Ohio there was a remarkable movement called the Women's Crusade which
is worthy of study. Mention some of the leaders; study also the careers
of John B. Gough, and Frances Willard.</p>

<p>South Dakota was admitted to the Union as a prohibition state; Kansas
and Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska have prohibition also, and some states
have local option by counties or towns; cities in many parts of the
country have it by precincts.</p>

<p>The history of the political Prohibition Party is a subject to be taken
up by itself. Mention its prominent leaders, their methods and the
results of the campaigns.</p>

<p>Discuss: Would enforced prohibition be beneficial to the state? Is local
option a success? Is there open violation of the law in prohibition
states? What of the legislative work of the Anti-Saloon League?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<h4>IV&mdash;MODERN MEDICINE AND SURGERY</h4>

<p>The new day in medicine and surgery began, when, in 1846 ether was
discovered, and chloroform a year later, and Warren, in the
Massachusetts General Hospital, popularized them. All operations,
however, were still attended with danger because of infection, till
Pasteur discovered the dangerous bacteria and Lister invented
sterilization. Then modern methods really began.</p>

<p>The field of possible operations at once widened; surgeons began to have
better operating rooms, more scientific preparation of patients before
operations and better dressings and care afterward. Not only antiseptic
but aseptic treatment became known. New anesthetics, and local ones have
been found; the use of oxygen and electricity have been beneficial; the
X-ray has been discovered and put to practical use.</p>

<p>Great sums of money have been set aside for research work, and new
serums have been found of enormous benefit to the public. Scientists are
looking for the germs of many diseases, and for their antidotes.</p>

<p>Wonderful new operations are full of interest; note especially the
transfusion of blood, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> preservation of tissue and transplanting
of living organs.</p>

<p>Have other papers on: the specialist as the supplanter of the general
practitioner; the new relation between medicine and hygiene; the
relation of the old family physician to his patients; the work of the
Red Cross Society, and the widespread knowledge of first aid to the
injured. What are the possibilities of the near future in medicine and
surgery? What in research work?</p>

<h4>V&mdash;MODERN MOVEMENTS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH</h4>

<p>Boards of Health in the state and community exist for the purpose of
controlling and repressing agencies which would undermine the health of
the people. Their work is far-reaching, but it may be grouped under the
following heads:</p>

<p>1. The care of the water supply is among its most important functions;
it must protect it from its source to the homes of the consumers,
overseeing all sewers, cesspools and drainage. It must also see that the
supply of ice is pure. It undertakes to care for all roads and
sidewalks, and their proper lighting. It is responsible for the
construction of buildings, as to safety, ventilation, plumbing and
draining.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It also insists on its notification of all disease and attends to
quarantining and disinfecting; it vaccinates; it fights tuberculosis; it
removes the sick to the proper place; it sees that the dead are properly
handled; it keeps a record of vital statistics.</p>

<p>3. It has an oversight of food supplies; it insists that the milk is
pure and carefully handled; it prevents the adulteration of foodstuffs
and drugs; it stops the sale of stale or unwholesome foods; it demands
clean slaughter houses; it sees that all dangerous animals are shut up
or killed, and dead ones removed from the streets; it prohibits
unpleasant odors, and smoke; it tries to do away with all public
nuisances; it seeks to exterminate the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>These topics may be taken up as far as time allows. Discuss in closing
such questions as: What does our local Board of Health do for us? Where
does it fail? What can women's clubs do to make it more effective?</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;MODERN IMPROVEMENTS IN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION</h4>

<p>One of the most important of recent events is the establishing by the
government of a Federal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> Children's Bureau, for the expert study of the
conditions of childhood, and suggestions for its betterment. This
included among other things, the outlook over their education.</p>

<p>The new school-houses built both in city and country are finer than have
existed before, and the ideas of education are widening daily. Clubs
should take up some of the following subjects:</p>

<p>The health of school children; what is being done to improve it? Study
the new sanitation and ventilation of school-houses; the disappearance
of the common drinking cup; the doctor's care of eyes, teeth, throats,
spines and ears; the supply of breakfasts to the under fed; the
out-of-door schools for tubercular pupils; the training in cleanliness.</p>

<p>The vocational schools in thirty states, with manual training, domestic
arts, industrial work and agriculture. Also vocational guidance in
choosing a business; finding situations, etc. The schools for
exceptional children, the foreigner, the backward, the crippled, the
blind, the epileptic, the morally defective.</p>

<p>The Montessori system; is it successful? Compare with the kindergarten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The training in patriotism; saluting the flag; birthdays of great men,
etc.</p>

<p>The graded country school of to-day; compare with "the little red
school-house." School play grounds in city and country. Gymnasiums.
Athletic fields. Close with a discussion: What is the standing of your
local school? Do teacher and parent work together? Is the school board
doing its best?</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;MODERN MUNICIPAL ART</h4>

<p>Municipal art, is art applied to cities. Its aim is to build up an
entire city with a view to symmetry, beauty and utility.</p>

<p>An Art Commission is appointed when a city decides to become beautiful,
and this draws up a far-reaching plan. Then all buildings put up must
conform to this, and nothing can be done at haphazard. Slums must
disappear, and model tenements take their place; streets must be cut
through congested districts to relieve them; business blocks must not be
over-high; inartistic public buildings and monuments must give way to
others; parks must be opened, trees planted along the streets, and
boulevards laid out. See what Chicago and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> Minneapolis have accomplished
in making themselves over.</p>

<p>Discuss foreign cities which are symmetrical, notably Paris and Berlin;
speak of our own capital, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.; show pictures of
well-lighted streets, of a good skyline; of superior paving. Show
pictures also of objectionable street advertising; electric signs;
alternate high and low buildings, ornate court-houses; ugly statues.</p>

<p>From the different magazines get illustrations of the "Garden Cities of
England," and other beautiful towns. Notice what can be done with
different building materials, and with vines and flower boxes on a city
residence street.</p>

<p>Discuss the sky scraper; is it necessary? What of apartment houses? of
elevated railroads? of disfiguring gas works, chimneys, manufactories?
What can women's clubs do toward making the home city beautiful?</p>

<p>See C.&nbsp;M. Robinson's The Improvement of Towns and Cities.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;MODERN BENEVOLENCE</h4>

<p>More money is given away to-day than ever before in the history of the
world. It is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> "the era of magnificent giving." Two hundred
million dollars is spent in benevolence yearly in the United States
alone, and it is estimated that in ten or fifteen years from two to four
billions will be given annually. Old methods are passing away, and new
ones taking their place. The subject of modern giving is one of immense
importance.</p>

<p>Clubs should introduce the study with a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of benevolences in the
past; gifts to hospitals, asylums, colleges, libraries, art galleries,
museums, missions and other institutions; then take up more recent
giving to such things as model tenements, homes for tubercular,
settlements, institutional churches, homes for working women, the Mills
hotels, trade and technical schools, homes for convalescents, seaside
homes for children, pensions for professors; modern schools for the
blind, the crippled, the orphan, teaching self support. Notice that the
trend of giving to-day is toward prevention of suffering as well as its
cure.</p>

<p>Great gifts to-day are largely in favor of science. Note the great
medical research laboratories in New York, and what they already
accomplished; also the endowment for individuals on special lines in
which they show marked ability. Study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> what is being done by
legislatures in establishing laws about bequests, their trusteeship, and
time limitations, and the new theory that no gift should be bestowed
without the possibility of change, since in twenty years conditions
alter. What of making and breaking wills? of funds left for institutions
which may not be always needed? of protection to society through state
boards, etc.?</p>

<p>Read the article on Giving in <i>The Survey</i>, December 28, 1912, which
discusses the various phases of modern giving.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRY LIFE</h4>

<p>Clubs may divide this subject into two heads, and have several programs
on each.</p>

<p>1. The farmer. After years of obscurity, the life of the farmer has
suddenly become of immense importance to society. To-day the Bureau of
Agriculture and other forces are rapidly changing its future. State
fairs, granges, courses of instruction for men and women in
school-houses, and "farmer's bulletins" give instruction; experiment
stations deal with such difficulties as weeds, soils, drainage, and
pests, and teach scientifically about cattle, poultry, bee keeping,
crops, and the dairy. Public and high schools, colleges and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
universities have courses in agriculture, which teach beside the
ordinary farm work, forestry, how to have good roads, how to take up
unusual work.</p>

<p>The telephone, the automobile and the parcel post all bring the farmer
nearer town. Speak also of the Commission on Country Life, and its work;
of abandoned farms; of the farmer's wife, and her problems; of the
farmer's sons and daughters, and their future. How can life be made more
easy and attractive on a farm?</p>

<p>2. Country Homes. Notice the extraordinary growth of the country home
for all the year, instead of for summer only. What are its difficulties
and what its advantages? Read of large estates, and describe some in the
Adirondacks, in the vicinity of Boston, New York, in the South, and
West; illustrate with pictures from magazines. Have a paper on Gardens,
and describe some; read from the many books on this subject. Take up
landscape gardening, and discuss its possibilities. What of country
sports? of golf, tennis, hunting, motoring, etc.? of bungalows, camps,
seashore cottages, etc.? of country lanes, of game preserves, forest
parks and the like. Speak of the enormous literature on country life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<h4>X&mdash;SOCIAL SERVICE</h4>

<p>Social service is of distinctly modern growth. It is the intelligent
understanding of the needs of to-day and of the best way to meet them.
Clubs should study it under some or all of these heads:</p>

<p>Read of the Schools of Philanthropy, where modern methods of relief are
taught, and the workers are trained for service in some branch; and the
American Institute of Social Service, the object of which is the
gathering and disseminating of information on all social thought and
service. The latter publishes monthly a pamphlet on present day problems
which is excellent for reference.</p>

<p>Discuss welfare work, the care of employers for employees; what has been
done? the ventilation of work rooms; safe machinery; pensions,
insurance, hospital, savings bank, care of sick at home, food, etc.</p>

<p>Settlements; their origin and history; what can neighborliness do for
the poor? Read of the work of Toynbee Hall and Hull House.</p>

<p>The Juvenile Courts; their origin and work. The Big Brother and Big
Sister movement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Work for the defective; for paupers; insane; consumptives; idle.</p>

<p>Prisons, and modern prison reform.</p>

<p>For children; cr&ecirc;ches; free kindergartens; seaside homes; floating
hospitals; pure milk and ice.</p>

<p>Relief of congestion in cities; parks and playgrounds; recreation piers.</p>

<p>Legal Aid societies and help for the aliens; legislation on women's and
children's labor.</p>

<p>The Charity Organization societies; nursing of poor; relief of want.</p>

<p>Education; moving pictures; music; open-air Christmas trees; free
beaches, etc.</p>

<p>For references see The Gospel of the Kingdom, published by the American
Institute of Social Service, and <i>The Survey</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>Begin the discussion of the day with a paper on the Modern Science of
Eugenics: How Far is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> It Practical? Have a Talk on the Spoiled Baby,
over-fed, over-amused, over-indulged; contrast with one on The Normal
Baby. Close with readings or recitations on Babyhood, poems from Eugene
Field, Stevenson, and others.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;SCHOOL</h4>

<p>The school life of the child should be discussed from the standpoint of
both parent and teacher. The watchful care over the child's morals is an
important topic. The child's home work, how much should be done; and at
what hours, is a subject for discussion. The school dress of little
girls, the tidiness of both boys and girls, school lunches, the plays of
the noon-hour, are all suggestive. Beautifying the school-room with
pictures, casts and flowers may well be considered.</p>

<p>Discuss the value of letting boys and girls grow up together as
playmates. Athletic games for girls is also a good topic to take up.
Play-rooms for children, with suggestions for the decoration of walls,
treatment of floors, and furnishings may be discussed. Sunday plays for
small children will be found full of interest. The growth of the
provision for play for city children is treated in many magazines of
recent date, with illustrations of playgrounds, garden spots,
roof-gardens and the like.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Trained Parent</i>&mdash;Preparation for parenthood. Character and
knowledge. Discussion of helpful books.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Normal Child</i>&mdash;The faults to be expected: forgetfulness, lack of
cleanliness, lack of promptness, temper, etc. How shall we deal with the
ordinary faults?</p>

<p>3. <i>Special Faults</i>&mdash;Disobedience, obstinacy, lack of self-control,
dishonesty, lying. Discrimination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> as to seriousness. How far is

child. The value of hero-worship.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Contagion of Character</i>&mdash;Childhood's keen vision. Force of
example versus reproof. The child as partner in the home work.</p>

<p>4. <i>Special Training</i>&mdash;Truthfulness. Chivalry and the spirit of honor.
Purity. How shall the mystery of sex be taught to a child?

<p>The department of child-study most discussed to-day is that of sex
education, and club women should certainly take it up. Consider its
necessity, the age at which instruction should begin, and the person who
should give it, the teacher scientifically, or the parent at home.</p>

morals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books to Consult</span>&mdash;Gow: Good Morals and Gentle Manners. Wiggin: Lessons
on Manners. Dewey: How to Teach Manners in the School-room.</p>

<p>A talk may follow the first paper, pointing out that kind treatment of
animals, especially of pets, tends to teach children gentleness,
sympathy, and consideration. A little paper might take up the subject of
the modern ideals of manners.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;OCCUPATIONS</h4>

<p>1. <i>Reading</i>&mdash;Direction by parents and librarians. To how much liberty
in taste and choice is a child entitled? Lists of good books for

Kimball: Games, Seat Work, and Sense Training Exercises. R.&nbsp;K. Row:
Educational Meaning of Manual Arts and Industries.</p>

<p>Prepare in advance a discussion on the subject of children's earning
money. Should they be paid for doing daily household duties, or not?
Does earning money tend to make boys mercenary? Take up also occupations
for invalid children and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> convalescents, and notice that handicraft is
better than games for these.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE CHILD AND MONEY</h4>

<p>1. <i>Sources of Supply</i>&mdash;Gifts, earnings, and prizes.</p>

Questions for High School Boys. Julia W. Dewey: Lessons on Morals.</p>

<p>This is considered a mercenary age, and a discussion may be prepared on
such subjects as these: How shall we keep our boys from becoming either
extravagant or mercenary? How may our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> girls be taught to understand the
value of money? What ought to be the relative emphasis on money in our
home life?</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;THE CHILD AND RELIGION</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Beginning of Religious Training</i>&mdash;Prayers for children to use.

<p>The Sunday-night supper should have a large place in the life of the
home. The children may prepare it alone or with slight assistance, and
it will be found an excellent way of interesting them if they tire of
the long afternoon. The subject of the memorizing of Scriptural passages
and of hymns may be discussed, and personal experiences on this line may
be given.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;MODERN CHILD STUDY</h4>

<p>1. <i>The New Movement and Its Breadth</i>&mdash;Interest among physicians,
teachers, clergymen, psychologists, and parents. Some reference to the
vast literature, encyclopedias, etc. Discussion of helpful books.</p>

<p>2. <i>Physical</i>&mdash;Study of food values for the individual baby and the
growing child. Fresh air and sleeping outdoors. The outdoor

Child Study. W.&nbsp;B. Drummond: The Child, His Nature and Nurture.</p>

<p>The subject of mothers' congresses may be discussed: Are they
practically helpful, or merely speculative? Present the topic of
institutions for children, homes and asylums for orphans, for the blind,
the crippled, the feeble-minded; also, children's courts and the Big
Brother movement. Discuss at this meeting the question of adopting
children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous Programs</span></h3>

<p>When clubs have serious subjects for their year's work, which require
considerable reading and the writing of substantial papers, it gives
variety to arrange the general program in such a way that a light
program comes between two heavy ones; or at least to have every third
meeting of quite different character from the rest.</p>

<p>Often clubs can invite a speaker from outside to take up most of the
hour; a traveller, a settlement worker, a college professor, an actor, a
journalist, a judge of a Children's Court, a student of bird life, all
have something worth while to contribute. Perhaps a writer will read
from his books; or a musician will sing or play, or an artist will tell
of life in the ateliers of Paris or Rome. Even in a small town one can
find some one who has a friend who will come and help in such ways, and
there is no better way to rouse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> interest in a club than to offer such
meetings occasionally.</p>

<p>Where it is impossible to provide anything of this kind, it is still a
good plan to have miscellaneous meetings from time to time; but there is
always the danger that these will be spoiled by having them consist of
odds and ends, a paper on one subject followed by another on something
which has no relation to the first, and perhaps a third which is still
further afield. It is best to have but one topic for each meeting, with
music if possible, and a social hour afterwards.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to begin a miscellaneous program is to take up
current events for ten minutes. It is possible to plan systematically
for these, so that one member is responsible for a report on foreign
affairs, wars or politics, or whatever is of national importance
anywhere; another for great scientific discoveries or important
inventions; a third, noteworthy music; a fourth, for the great book of
the hour; a fifth, for anything of especial importance to women. No one
should write these brief outlines, but merely give them informally. The
material can be found by following the daily papers, or looking up
articles in review magazines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>Clubs which study a historical or literary subject often find it
interesting to begin these miscellaneous programs with a roll-call,
members answering to their names with quotations from the authors of the
period, or from one author alone. There are books of quotation which
give the best short lines for such recitations, and one gets a good, if
brief idea of writers in this way.</p>

<p>As to the matter of miscellaneous programs, the subjects should not be
too heavy and papers should not be too long or too seriously written.
Popular themes, the books of some well-known author, the magazines of
the day, a philanthropy, a brief study of a political figure, all work
out easily. Above all, whatever theme is selected, there should be a
discussion of the subject at the close of the meeting. Women do not
speak easily and naturally impromptu, and it is an immensely valuable
training to be obliged to present one's views clearly, concisely and to
the point before even a small audience, and even a short experience of
this kind in a club is of enormous assistance. If the subject of the
discussion is announced in advance members may prepare themselves to
take part.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<h4>I&mdash;A CENTURY OF DRESS</h4>

<p>A very simple but most interesting program for one miscellaneous meeting
may be prepared on this theme. Divide it into three parts, having the
first paper on The Dress of Our Grandmothers; speak of its durability,
its simplicity, its lack of change from one season to another; mention
the bonnets, mitts, slippers, muffs and fans; illustrate with old prints
or fashion plate or illustrations from books of about 1820 and 1830.</p>

<p>The second paper would then be on The Dress of Our Mothers. This will
cover the periods of 1860, with its hoopskirts, its coalscuttle bonnets,
its shawls, worked collars, and cameo pins; 1871 too, should be
represented, with the tied back skirts, the small hats perched on
chignons, the ridiculous sunshades. Read Miss Flora McFlimsey at this
point.</p>

<p>The third paper would be on Our Own Dress, showing the extreme styles,
short, with scanty skirts and huge hats. Speak briefly of the sudden
change of styles and their causes, and the tendency to extravagance.</p>

<p>Discuss topics such as these: How far shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> we follow the dictates of
fashion? How much of a woman's income should be spent for clothes? What
of our daughters' dress?</p>

<p>It will add to the interest of this program if the three papers are read
by members in the costumes of the times of which they speak, or if three
or four tableaux are shown illustrating the papers. Have little ballads
about dress sung if possible, the Old Grey Bonnet, the Owld Plaid Shawl,
and Oh Dear, What Can the Matter Be? among others.</p>

<p>Several programs might easily be made from this outline; one, on Peasant
Dress, with illustrations from all countries; another on Colonial Dress;
a third on Quaker Dress. By using the dress of all nations and all
times, an entire year might be delightfully spent on the subject of
Women's Costumes.</p>

<h4>II&mdash;EMERSON AND HIS TIMES</h4>

<p>Clubs which prefer literary study will find this subject most
interesting, and like the previous one, capable of expansion into many
programs.</p>

<p>Begin with a roll-call, the responses being selections from Emerson's
prose and verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>The first paper would be on his boyhood, his parents, his home life and
education, his marriage, his ministry, his quiet life in Concord.</p>

<p>The second paper would take up the friends so closely associated with
him, especially Alcott, Margaret Fuller, Thoreau, Longfellow and
Whittier. The story of Brook Farm may come in here, or have a special
paper by itself; close with his travels in England.</p>

<p>The last paper would be on Emerson's work as author and lecturer; of his
place in his own day; of what Englishmen thought of him, especially
Carlyle; of the influence of his essays on young men.</p>

<p>Have readings from prose and verse; read also from some estimates of him
by great writers. See A Memoir of Ralph Waldo Emerson, by James Eliot
Cabot. Discuss, Is Emerson's place among philosophers what it was a
generation ago? Does the modern idea of social service find
encouragement in him? What was his attitude in regard to individualism?</p>

<h4>III&mdash;CHILDREN AND BOOKS</h4>

<p>This is one of the topics on which it would be interesting to have the
club invite some speaker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> perhaps a librarian, to speak. She would
probably take up some of the following topics. The effect of the public
library for children of the poor, of their interest in it, their delight
in the warm, charming reading-room, their growth in personal cleanliness
as they learn to care for the books entrusted to them. Of what books
children draw from a library; of the reading of history, of fairy
stories, of poetry, of books of adventure. Definite and helpful
suggestions will be given for children who have books at home, of what
parents should give them to read, and how to interest them in good
literature.</p>

<p>If no speaker can be had for the meeting, divide these topics into two
or three papers, and have members write or speak on them.</p>

<p>Close with a discussion on these lines: What books have replaced the
Rollo Books, Little Prudy, and the Elsie Books? What of giving children
grown-up writers to read such as Shakespeare, Don Quixote, Mallory and
Bunyan? Does much reading of stories vitiate their taste for better
literature?</p>

<p>This program will be more delightful if songs about children are
interspersed; Eugene Field's verses set to music by De Koven are
admirable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<h4>IV&mdash;MURAL PAINTING</h4>

<p>In preparing this program look up in advance plenty of illustrations
from historical books on art and architecture, magazines of art, and
prints and photographs of famous examples, such as the Sistine Chapel.</p>

<p>The first paper will of course deal with the earliest form of mural
painting, found in Egypt, Assyria, and Greece. Describe these, and
notice the colors used by the Greeks.</p>

<p>The second paper should speak of the wonderful paintings in churches, of
altar pieces, and the decorations in fresco of walls and ceilings;
select from the many examples of churches in Italy. Then the guild halls
of the middle ages should be mentioned, and the curious work on bridges
and elsewhere in Germany. The third paper should speak of the
extraordinary interest to-day in mural painting; note that of the Houses
of Parliament and other places abroad; show pictures of the work of
Abbey and Sargent in the Boston Public Library, and of Blashfield and La
Farge in the Congressional Library at Washington and elsewhere, and the
excellent mural paintings on our public buildings, court houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> and
capitols, and some public schools in New York.</p>

<p>Discuss: The Cost of Mural Paintings To-day: Are They Worth While?</p>

<h4>V&mdash;THE ART OF CONVERSATION</h4>

<p>This subject opens a whole literary field and will be found delightful
to expand into several meetings. A roll-call might be answered with
famous <i>bons mots</i> from some of the men and women to be studied. Sidney
Smith, Charles Lamb and others have left many.</p>

<p>The first paper might be on famous conversationalists; mention Johnson,
Horace Walpole, Macauley, Fanny Burney, Samuel Rogers, Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu and Sidney Smith, among many others.</p>

<p>The second would follow with some account of famous salons, especially
those of France at the time of R&eacute;camier; see Sainte-Beuve's essays on
this theme. What of corresponding salons elsewhere?</p>

<p>A third paper would speak informally of conversation to-day; is it
becoming a lost art? Do we consider it seriously?</p>

<p>This paper will lead naturally to a discussion on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> these and similar
themes: What of our home table talk? Should children be taught to
converse rather than to chatter? Shall we prepare ourselves in advance
for conversations at dinners and other social occasions? What is the
relation between a good conversationalist and a good listener?</p>

<h4>VI&mdash;MENDELSSOHN</h4>

<p>When club members can not only write papers but also play and sing, this
will be found a popular little program: Mendelssohn's famous
grandfather; his father, interested in his son's genius; his early home
life; his sister Fanny; the little Sunday morning concerts; his
education, his versatility, his gay, affectionate nature.</p>

<p>The second paper may be on the early beginnings of his work as a
composer; of his first opera; the overture to Midsummer Night's Dream,
and the formation and work of his choir. Speak of his travels in England
and on the continent, of his marriage; his call to Berlin by the king,
and his operas and oratorios; the foundation of his music school; and
last his death.</p>

<p>The third paper should discuss his position among musicians, his
greatest work and its lasting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> qualities. Discuss: Does Mendelssohn rank
among the great musicians?</p>

<p>Between each two papers have played some of the Songs Without Words, and
others of his best known compositions, and have some of his songs sung,
or selections from his oratorios; or they may be given by using musical
records. The Lark, I Would that My Love, and Had I the Wings of a Dove,
are among the best.</p>

<h4>VII&mdash;COLLEGES FOR BOYS AND GIRLS</h4>

<p>This is another popular program, and one easily prepared and discussed.
Divide it into two parts: first, the great universities, Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and Columbia; their history; their opportunities; show
pictures of each campus. Follow with a paper on the small college; its
advantages; the state universities; college athletics; fraternities,
dangers of college life; does college prepare for a business life?</p>

<p>Next take girls' colleges in the same general way; describe Bryn Mawr,
Vassar, Wellesley and Smith; and show pictures of them. Have papers on,
Is a college education essential for all girls? and What are its
advantages over the boarding-school, and its disadvantages? and What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> of
athletics for girls? and Should their studies be those of men's colleges
entirely?</p>

<p>Discuss these subjects, and add others: Does college life unfit a girl
for life at home? Is a college girl likely to demand a career? Does she
marry? Have some college songs sung: Fair Harvard, Old Nassau, Neath the
Elms of Dear Old Yale, and others.</p>

<h4>VIII&mdash;THE CARE OF CHILDREN AND THE AGED BY THE STATE</h4>

<p>This is one of the subjects in line with the philanthropy of to-day, and
will be found suggestive of social work for women's clubs.</p>

<p>The first paper might be on Orphan Asylums; the care of young children,
their food, dress, education and personal oversight. What of adopting
children from asylums? What of placing children in homes instead of
asylums?</p>

<p>The second paper would take up: the defective children to be cared for
in asylums. The blind, deaf, epileptic and idiots.</p>

<p>The third paper would be on the care of the aged; of almshouses,
especially those of the county; are they sanitary, well cared for and
cheerful? Are the old people well fed, clothed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> and amused? Are husbands
and wives separated?</p>

<p>The last paper might touch upon English almshouses on the cottage plan
and contrast them with our own large institutions.</p>

<p>Discuss the near-by almshouses, and question what can be done to better
conditions.</p>

<h4>IX&mdash;RECENT BOOKS</h4>

<p>A group of three or at the most four books are quite enough for a
miscellaneous program for one afternoon. They may be selected on one
general theme, such as biography, or on several. The first book
suggested here is a delightful life study, that of Robert E. Lee, Man
and Soldier, by Thomas Nelson Page. Notice the clearness and beauty of
the style, the appreciation of the man's character and work, and the
well chosen descriptions of his associates. Read part of a chapter near
the close of the book.</p>

<p>Second, have a paper on The Promised Land, by Mary Antin, one of the
really great books of to-day. Tell the story of her life, reading here
and there from her own words; show how she was handicapped and yet how
she rose, and speak of the fact that such women bring inspiration to our
shores.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Third, take The Three Bront&euml;s, by May Sinclair, a book of fascinating
interest. Briefly give a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the family, and speak of the work of
each sister; compare with Clement Shorter's The Bront&euml;s and Their
Circle.</p>

<p>Or, for a program on several topics, have these three books for the
papers: first, The Lady of the Decoration, by Frances Little. Give a
review, with its story, the local color, the humor and pathos; read
short selections.</p>

<p>Second, take Heretics, by Chesterton; here again, review his style, his
mannerisms, and note his light touch; read briefly from two essays.</p>

<p>Third, take a collection of short stories, perhaps Jacobs' Dialstone
Lane. Speak of his quaint dry humor, his sense of the incongruous, the
similarity of his captain-heroes, and the absurdity of his plots. Read
one story.</p>

<h4>X&mdash;MARKETS</h4>

<p>For a last program take the subject of Markets. If possible, illustrate
some of these foreign markets mentioned, the pictures to be found in
magazines.</p>

<p>Flower markets will make a first paper; notice those of Paris
especially, near the Madelaine;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> of Covent Garden, London. Note the
smaller flower markets in connection with the ordinary markets of
cities.</p>

<p>A second paper may discuss famous markets in our own land, notably the
markets of New Orleans and other Southern cities; their picturesqueness;
their value to the housewife. Are they hygienic?</p>

<p>Third, take up the larger aspects of the subject; our great meat markets
in cities here and abroad; note the market at Smithfield, London, on
Saturdays, and the old Fulton Market of New York, and others. What can
be done to regulate our markets, and make them clean and wholesome? What
have women done here of recent years to clean up the markets of the
West? What of foreign markets, especially in Germany?</p>

<p>Discuss the practical aspects of the subjects. What of the relation of
farmers to customers? Can the latter insist on cleanliness and fair
trade? What has the pure food legislation done on those points?</p>

<h4>THE END</h4>
